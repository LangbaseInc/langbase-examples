Employees may work remotely up to two days per week, with manager approval. Remote workdays should be scheduled in advance and documented in the company's HR system. Employees are expected to be available during standard working hours and to maintain productivity levels consistent with in-office work. Company equipment, such as laptops and phones, should be used for remote work to ensure security and compliance with company policies.
