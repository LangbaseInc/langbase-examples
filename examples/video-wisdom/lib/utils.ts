		transcript: `So I was trying to figure out how to do photorealistic AI photos and it was... Stable Diffusion by itself is not doing that well. The faces look all mangled- - Yeah. - And it doesn't have enough resolution or something to do that well. But I started seeing these base models, these fine tune models, and people would train them on porn, and I would try them, and they would be very photorealistic. They would have bodies that actually made sense, like body anatomy. But if you look at the photo realistic models that people use now, still, there's still core of porn there, of naked people- - Yeah. - So I need to prompt out the naked, and everyone needs to do this with AI startups with imaging. You need to prompt out the naked stuff. - You have to keep reminding the model you need to put clothes on the thing. - Yeah, don't put naked 'cause it's very risky. I have Google Vision- - Yeah. - That checks every photo before it's shown to the user to like check for NSWF. - Like nipples detector? Oh, NSFW detector. (chuckles) - Because the journalist gets very angry. - The following is a conversation with Pieter Levels, also known on X as levelsio. He is a self-taught developer and entrepreneur who designed programs shipped and ran over 40 startups, many of which are hugely successful. In most cases, he did it all by himself while living the digital nomad life in over 40 countries, in over 150 cities, Programming on a laptop while chilling on a couch, using Vanilla HTML, jQuery, PHP, and SQLite He builds and ships quickly and improves on the fly, all in the open, documenting his work, both his successes and failures with a raw honesty of a true indie hacker. Pieter is an inspiration to a huge number of developers and entrepreneurs who love creating cool things in the world that are hopefully useful for people. This was an honor and a pleasure for me. This is the "Lex Fridman Podcast." To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Pieter Levels. You've launched a lot of companies and built a lot of products. As you say, most failed, but some succeeded. What's your philosophy behind building the startups that you did? - I think my philosophy is very different than most people in startups. 'Cause most people in startups, they build a company and they raise money, right? And they hire people, and then they build a product, and they find something that makes money. I don't really raise money. I don't use VC funding. I do everything myself. I'm a designer. I'm the developer. I make everything, I make the logo. So for me, I'm much more scrappy. And because I don't have funding, I need to go fast. I need to make things fast to see if an idea works, right? I have an idea in my mind and I build it, build like a micro, mini startup. And I launch it very quickly, like within two weeks or something of building it, and I check if there's demand. And if people actually sign up, and not just sign up, but if people actually pay money, right? They need to take out their credit cards, pay me money, and then I can see if the idea is validated. And most ideas don't work, like as you say, most fail. - So there's this rapid iterative phase where you just build a prototype that works, launch it. - Yeah. - See if people like it, improving it really, really quickly to see if people like it a little bit more enough to pay, and all that. That whole rapid process is how you think of. - Yeah, I think it's very rapid, and it's like if I compare to, for example, Google, like big tech companies. Especially Google right now is kind of struggling. They made transformers. They invented all the AI stuff years ago, and they never really shipped. They could have shipped ChatGPT, for example, I think I heard in 2019, and they never shipped it because they were so stuck in bureaucracy. But they had everything, they had the data, they had the tech, they had the engineers, and they didn't do it. And it's because these big organizations, it can make you very slow. So being alone by myself on my laptop, in my underwear in a hotel room or something, I can ship very fast, and I don't need to ask legal for like, "Oh, can you vouch for this?" I can just go and ship. - Do you always code in your underwear? Your profile picture, you're slouching- - Yeah. - On a couch in your underwear, chilling on a laptop. - No, but I do wear shorts a lot, and I usually just wear shorts and no T-shirt 'cause I'm always too hot. I'm always overheating. - Thank you for showing up not just in your underwear but- - Yeah. - Wearing shorts. - And I'm still wearing this for you, but- - Thank you. Thank you for dressing up. (Pieter chuckles) - Since I go to the gym, I'm always too hot. - What's your favorite exercise in the gym? - Man, overhead press. - Overhead press like shoulder press? - Yeah. - Okay. - But it feels good 'cause you win, 'cause when you- (Lex laughs) I do 60 kilos. - Yeah. - So it's like 120 pounds or something. It's my only thing I can do well in the gym. And you stand like this and you're like, "I did it," like a winner pose. - It's victory thing. Yeah. - The victory pose. I do bench press, squat, deadlifts. (Lex and Pieter laughs) - Hence the mug. - Yes. - Talking to my therapist. - Yeah. - It's a deadlift. - Yeah. Because it acts like therapy for me. - [Lex] Yeah, yeah, it is. - Which is controversial to say. If I say this on Twitter, people get angry, - Physical hardship is a kind of therapy. - Yeah. - I just rewatched "Happy People" A Year In The Taiga," that Werner Herzog film, where they document people that are doing trapping. They're essentially just working for survival in the wilderness year round. - Yeah. - And there's a deep happiness to their way of life- - Yeah. - Because they're so busy in it, in nature. - Yeah, 100%. - There's something about that physical- - Physical, yeah. - Toil. - Yeah, my dad taught me that. My dad always did construction in the house. He's always renovating the house. He breaks through one room and then he goes to the next room, and he is just going in a circle around the house for the last 40 years. So he is always doing construction in the house and it's his hobby. He taught me, when I'm depressed or something, he says, "Get a big," what do you call it? Like a big mountain of sand or something from construction, and just get a shovel and bring it to the other side and just do physical labor, do hard work, and do something. Set a goal, do something. And I kind of did that with startups too. - Yeah, construction is not about the destination, man. It's about the journey. - Yeah. (chuckles) - Sometimes I wonder people who are always remodeling their house. Is it really about the remodeling or- - [Pieter] No, no, its not. - Is it about the project? - It's the journey. - The puzzle of it. - No, he doesn't care about the results. Well, he shows me, he's like, "It's amazing." I'm like, "Yeah, it's amazing." But then he wants to go to the next room. But I think it's very metaphorical for work, 'cause I also, I never stop work. I go to the next website, or I make a new one, right? or I make a new startup. So I'm always like... To give you something to wake up in the morning, and like, have coffee and then kiss your girlfriend, and then you have like a goal. Today I'm gonna fix this . Today I'm gonna fix this bug or something. I'm gonna do something. You have something to wake up to. And I think maybe especially as a man, also women, but you need a hard work. You need like an endeavor, I think. - How much of the building that you do is about money? How much is it about just a deep internal happiness? - It's really about fun, 'cause I was doing it when I didn't make money, right? That's the point. So I was always coding, I was making music. I made electronic music, drum bass music 20 years ago, and I was always making stuff. So I think creative expression is like a meaningful work that's so important. It's so fun. It's so fun to have like a daily challenge where you try figure stuff out. - But the interesting thing is you built a lot of successful products and you never really wanted to take it to that level where you scale real big- - Yeah. - And sell it to a company or something like this. - Yeah, the problem is I don't dictate that, right? If more people start using it, if millions of people suddenly start using it and it becomes big, I'm not gonna say, "Oh, stop signing up to my website and pay me money." But I never raised funding for it. And I think, 'cause I don't like the stressful life that comes with it. I have a lot of founder friends and they tell me secretly. With hundreds of millions of dollars in funding and stuff, they tell me, "Next time, if I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna do it like you because it's more fun, it's more indie, it's more chill, it's more creative." They don't like to be manager, right? You become like a CEO, you become a manager. And I think a lot of people that start startups, when they become a CEO, they don't like that job actually, but they can't really exit it. But they like to do the groundwork, the coding. So I think that keeps you happy, doing something creative. - Yeah, it's interesting how people are pulled towards that, to scale to go really big, and you don't have that honest reflection with yourself, like what actually makes you happy? 'Cause for a lot of great engineers, what makes them happy is the building, the quote, unquote, "individual contributor." - Yeah. - like where you're actually still coding or you're- - Yeah. - Actually still building. And they let go of that, and then they become unhappy, but some of that is the sacrifice needed to have a impact at scale if you truly believe in a thing you're doing. - But look at Elon. He's doing things million times bigger than me, and would I wanna do that? I don't know, you can't really choose these things, right? But I really respect that. I think Elon's very different from VC founders. VC, it's like software. There's a lot of bullshit in this world, I think. There's a lot of there's dodgy, finance stuff happening there, I think. And I never have concrete evidence about it, but your gut tells you something's going on with companies getting sold to- - Yeah. - Friends and VCs, and then they do reciprocity and this shady financial dealings. With Elon, that's not. He's just raising money from investors and he's actually building stuff. He needs the money to build stuff, hard hardware stuff, and that I really respect. - You said that there's been a few low points in your life. You've been depressed, and building is one of the ways you get out of that. Can you talk to that? Can you take me to that place, that time when you were at a low point? - So I was in Holland and I graduated university, and I didn't wanna get a normal job, and I was making some money with YouTube 'cause I had this music career and I uploaded my music to YouTube. And YouTube started paying me with AdSense, like $2,000 a month, $3,000 a month. And all my friends got normal jobs, and we stopped hanging out, 'cause people would, like in university, hang out, chill at each other's houses, you go party. But when people get jobs, they only party in the weekend, and they don't hang anymore in the week 'cause you need to be at the office. And I was like, "This is not for me. I wanna do something else." And I was starting getting this like, I think it's like Saturn return when you turn 27. It's like some concept where Saturn returns to the same place in the orbit that it was when you're born. - I'm learning so many things. - [Pieter] It's some astrology thing. - So many truly special artists died when they were 27. - [Pieter] Exactly, there's something with 27, man. And it was for me. I started going crazy- - Yeah. - Because I didn't really see my future in Holland, buying a house, going living in the suburbs, and stuff. So I flew out, I went to Asia, started digital nomading, and did that for a year. And then that made me feel even worse, 'cause I was like alone in hotel rooms, looking at the ceiling. What am I doing with my life? I was working on startups and stuff on YouTube, but what is the future here? While my friends in Holland were doing really well and living normal life. So I was getting very depressed and I'm like an outcast. My money was shrinking. I wasn't making money anymore a lot. I was making $500 a month or something, And I was looking at the ceiling thinking like, "Now I'm 27, I'm a loser." And that's the moment when I started building startups. And it was because my dad said, "If you're depressed, you need to get sand, get shovel, start shoveling, doing something. You can't just sit still." Which is kinda like a interesting way to deal with depression. It's not like, "Oh, let's talk about it." It's more like, "Let's go do something." And I started doing a project called 12 Startups in 12 Months where every month I would make something, like a project, and I would launch it with Stripe, so people could pay for it. - So the basic format is try to build a thing, put it online, and put Stripe to where you can pay money for it. - Yeah, add a Stripe... I'm not sponsored by Stripe, but add a Stripe checkout button. - Is that still the easiest way to just like pay for stuff, Stripe? - 100%, I think so, yeah. - It's a cool company. They just made it so easy. You can just click and- - Yeah. And they're really nice. The CEO, Patrick, is really nice. - Behind the scenes, it must be difficult to actually make that happen because that used to be a huge problem. - [Pieter] Merchant. - Just adding a thing, a button where you can pay for a thing. - Dude. - It's- - Dude, I know this because when I was- - Trustworthy. - Nine years old, I was making websites also, and I tried to open a merchant account. There was like before Stripe you would have like, I think it was called Worldpay. So I had to fill out all these forms, and then I had to fax them to America from Holland with my dad's fax. It was on my dad's name, and he had to sign for this, and he started reading these terms and conditions, which is he's liable for 100 million in damages. And he's like, "I don't wanna sign this." I'm like, "Dad, come on, I need a merchant account. I need to make money on the internet." - Yeah. (chuckles) - And he signed it, and we faxed it to America, and I had a merchant accounts, but then nobody paid for anything, so that was the problem, But it's much easier now. You can sign up, you add some codes, and yeah. - So 12 startups in 12 months. - [Pieter] Yeah. - Startup number one, what was that? What were you feeling? Were you sitting behind the computer, how much do you actually know about building stuff at that point? - Well, I could code a little bit 'cause I did the YouTube channel and I made a website for... I would make websites for the YouTube channel. It was called "Panda Mix Show." And it was like these electronic music mixes, like dubstep, or drum bass, or techno house. - [Lex] I saw one of them had Flash. Were you using Flash? - Yeah, my album, my CD album was using Flash. Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. - I sold my CD, yeah. - Kids, Flash was a- - Flash was cool. - Software. This is the break that- - Yeah, like grandpa, but Flash was cool. - Yeah, and there was... What it is called? Boy, I should remember this ActionScript. There's some kind of programming language - Script, yeah, yeah, ActionScript. - Oh, yeah. - It was in Flash. Back then that was the JavaScript. - The JavaScript, yeah. - Yeah. And I thought that's gonna, that's supposed to be the dynamic thing that takes over the internet. - Yeah. - I invested so many hours in learning that. - And Steve Jobs killed it. - Steve Jobs. - Steve Jobs said, "Flash Sucks, stopped using it." Everyone is like, "Okay." - That guy was right though, right? - Yeah, I don't know, yeah. Well, it was a closed platform I think and- - Closed. - But this is ironic 'cause Apple, they're not very open. - Right. - But back then Steve want was like, this is closed. We should not use it. And it's a security problems I think, which sounded like a cop out. I just wanted to say that to make it look kind of bad. But Flash was cool, yeah. - Yeah, it was cool for a time. - Yeah. - Listen, animated GIFs were cool for a time too. - Yeah. - They came back in a different way. - Yeah. - As a meme though. I mean like, I even remember when GIFs were actually cool, not ironically cool. - Yeah. - There's like, on the internet you would have like a dancing rabbit or something like this. - [Pieter] Yeah. - And that was really exciting. - No, you had like the Lex homepage. Everything was centered. - Yeah. - And you had like Pieter's homepage and on the construction. - Yeah. - GIF which was like a guy with a helmet and the lights. It was amazing. - And there banners. Yeah, that's before like Google AdSense, you would've like banners for advertising. - It was amazing, yeah. - And a lot of links to porn I think. - Yeah. - Or porny type things. - I think that devil's squared, and merchant accounts people would use for, people would make money a lot. Only money made on internet was like porn or a lot of it. - Yeah, it was a dark place. It's still a dark place. - Yeah. - But there's beauty in the darkness. Anyway, so you did some basic HTML. - Yeah, yeah, but I had to learn the actual like coding. So this was good. It was a good idea to like launch startup, so I could learn the codes, learn basic stuff. But it was still very scrappy 'cause I didn't have time to, which is on purpose. I didn't have time to spend a lot of, I had a month to do something, so I couldn't spend more than a month. And I was pretty strict about that. And I published it as a blog post. So people, I think I put it on Hacker News and people would check kinda like, oh, did you actually, you know. I felt like accountability, 'cause I put it public, that I actually had to do it. - Do you remember the first one you did? - I think it was Play My Inbox, 'cause back then my friends, we would send like cool... It was before Spotify, I think, we would send like... 2013, we would send music to each other, like YouTube links. This is a cool song, this is a cool song. And it was these giant email threads on Gmail. And they were like unnavigable. So I made an app that would log into your Gmail, get them emails and find ones of YouTube links and then make kinda like a gallery of your songs. Essentially Spotify, and my friends loved it. - Was it scraping it? Like what was API? - No, it uses like a POP like POP or IMAP, Actually check your email, so that like privacy concerns, 'cause it would get all your emails to find YouTube links. But then I wouldn't save anything. But that was fun. And that first product already would get pressed, when think like some tech media and stuff. And I was like, that's cool. It didn't make money, there was no payment button, but actually people using it. I think tens of thousands of people used it. - That's a great idea. I wonder why, why don't we have that? Why don't we have things that access Gmail and extract some useful aggregate information. - Yeah, yeah, you could tell Gmail, don't give me all the emails, just give me the ones with YouTube links- - Yeah. - Or something like that. - Yeah, I mean there is a whole ecosystem of apps you can build on top of the Google. - Yeah. - But people don't really- - [Pieter] Never do this, I've ever see them. - They build... I've seen a few, like Boomerang, there's a few apps that are like good, but just- - Yeah. - I wonder what... Maybe it's not easy to make money. - I think it's hard to get people to pay for these like extensions and plugins, you know. - Yeah. - 'Cause it's not a real app, so it's not like people don't value it. People value, oh this... And a plugin should be free. When I want to use a plugin in Google Sheets or something, I'm not gonna pay for it. It should be free. But if you go to a website and you actually, okay, I need this product, I'm gonna pay for this 'cause it's a real product. So even though it's the same code in the back. It's a plugin. - Yeah, I mean you could do it through extensions, like Chrome extensions through from the browser. - Yeah, but who pays for Chrome extensions, right? - Nobody. - Barely anybody. - [Lex] Nobody. - That's not a good place to make money, probably. - Yeah, that sucks. - Chrome extension should be a extension for your startup. You know, you have a product. - Yeah. - Oh, we also have a Chrome extension. - I wish the Chrome extension would be the product. I wish Chrome would support that. - [Pieter] Yeah. - Where you could pay for it easily. Because imagine, I can imagine a lot of products that would just live as extensions, like improvements for social media. - Yeah. - A thing that- - It's GPTs. - GPTs, yeah. - Like these ChatGPTs, they're gonna charge money for now. And you get a rev share, I think from OpenAI. I made a lot of them also. - Why? We'll talk about it. - Yeah. - So let's rewind back. (Pieter laughs) It's a pretty cool idea to do 12 startups in 12 months. What's it take to build a thing in 30 days? At that time, how hard was that? - I think the hard part is figuring out what you shouldn't add, right? Which you shouldn't build because you don't have time. So you need to build a landing page. Well, you need to make the... (Lex laughs) You need to build the product actually, 'cause it need to be something they pay for. Do you need to build a login system? Maybe no, maybe you can build some scrappy login system. For Photo AI, you sign up, you pay, Stripe checkout, and you get a login link. And when I started out, there was only a login link with a hash and that's just a static link. So it's very easy to log in. - Yeah. - It's not so safe. What if you link the link and now I have real Google login, but that took like a year. So keeping it very scrappy is very important too, because you don't have time. You need to focus on what you can build fast. So money, Stripe, build a product, build a landing page. You need to think about how are people gonna find this? So are you gonna put it on Reddit or something? How are you gonna put it on Reddit without being looked at as a spammer, right? If you say, "Hey, this is my new startup, you should use it." No, nobody gets deleted. Maybe if you find a problem that a lot of people on Reddit already have and sub-Reddit, and you solve that problem and say, "Sub-people, I made this thing that might solve your problem and maybe it's free for now." That could work. But you need to be very narrow it down, what you're building. - Time is limited. - Yeah. - Actually, can we go back to the, you laying in a room feeling like a loser? - [Pieter] Yeah. - I still feel like a loser sometimes Can you speak to that feeling, to that place of just like, feeling like a loser? Because I think a lot of people in this world are laying in a room right now listening to this. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - And feeling like a loser. - Okay, so I think it's normal if you're young that you feel like a loser, first of all. - Especially, when you're 27. - Yes. Yeah, especially. - There's like a peak. - Yeah, yeah, I think 20 is the peak. And so I would not kill yourselves. It's very important. Just get through it. Because you have nothing, probably no money, you have no business, you have no job yet. Jordan Peterson said this, I saw it somewhere, people are depressed because they have nothing. They don't have a girlfriend. They don't have a boyfriend. They don't have a... You need stuff, you need like, or a family. You need things around you. You need to build a life for yourself. If you don't build a life for yourself, you'll be depressed. So if you're alone in Asia in a hostel looking at the ceiling, and you don't have any money coming in, you don't have a girlfriend, you don't, of course, you're depressed. It's logic. But back then, if you're in a moment, you think there's not logic, there's something wrong with me. - [Lex] Yeah. - And also I think I started getting like anxiety, and I think I started going a little bit crazy where I think travel can make you sane. And I know this because I know that there's like digital nomads that they kill themselves. I haven't checked the comparison with baseline people, like suicide rate. But I have a hunch, especially in the beginning when it was a very new thing like 10 years ago, that it can be very psychologically taxing. And you're alone a lot, back then when you travel alone, there was no other digital nomads back then, a lot. So you're in a strange culture. You look different in everybody. I was in Asia, everybody's really nice in Thailand, but you're not part of the culture. You're traveling around, you're hopping from city to city. You don't have a home anymore. You feel disrooted. - And you're constantly in the outcast and that you're different from everybody else. - Yes, exactly. Like Thailand, people are so nice. - [Lex] Yes. - But you still feel like outcast. And then I think the digital nomads I met then were all kinda like, it was like shady business. But they were like vigilantes 'cause it was a new thing. And one guy was selling illegal drugs. It was an American guy. It was selling illegal drugs via UPS to Americans on this website. There were a lot of dropshippers doing shady stuff. There's a lot of shady things going on there. And they didn't look like very balanced people. They didn't look like people I wanted to hang with. So I also felt outcast from other foreigners in Thailand, other digital nomads. And I was like, "Man, I made a big mistake." And then I went back to Holland and then I got even more depressed. - You said digital nomad. What is digital nomad? What is that way of life? What is the philosophy there? And the history of the movement. - I struck upon it on accident. 'Cause I was like, I'm gonna graduate university and then I need to get out of here. I'll fly to Asia, 'cause I've been before in Asia. I studied in Korea in 2009. Study exchange. I was like, Asia is easy. Thailand is easy. And I'll just go there, figure things out. And it's cheap. It's very cheap. Chiang Mai, I would live like for $150 per month rent. - Yeah. - For like a private room. Pretty good. So I struggled on this on accident. I was like, okay, there's other people on laptops working on their startup or working remotely. Back then nobody worked remotely, but they worked on their businesses, right? And they would live in Columbia or Thailand or Vietnam or Bali. They would live kind of like in more cheap places. And it looked a very adventurous life. You travel around, you build your business. There's no pressure from your home society, right? You're American. So you get pressure from American society telling you kind of what to do. You need to buy a house or you need to do this stuff. I had this in Holland too. And you can get away from this pressure. You can kind of feel like you're free. There's nobody telling you what to do. But that's also why you start feeling like you go crazy 'cause you are free, you're disattached from anything and anybody, you're disattached from your culture. You're disattached from the culture you're probably in, 'cause you're staying very short. - I think Franz Kafka said, "I'm free, therefore I'm lost." - Man, that's so true. Yeah, that's exactly the point. And yeah, freedom is like, it's the definition of no constraints, right? Anything is possible. You can go anywhere. And everybody's like, "Oh, that must be super nice." Freedom, you must be very happy. And it's opposites, I don't think that makes you happy. I think constraints probably make you happy, and that's a big lesson I learned then. - But what were they making for money? So you're saying they were doing shady stuff at that time? - For me, 'cause I was more like a developer. I wanted to make startups kind of, and it was like drugs being shipped to America, like diet pills and stuff. Non-FDA proof stuff. And they would like let... They would say with beers and they would laugh about like all the dodgy shit kind of they're doing. - That part of, okay. - That kind of vibe. Kind of sleazy, e-comm vibe. I'm not saying all e-comm is these. - Right. - But, you know, this vibe. - It could be a vibe and your vibe was more build cool shit. - Make cool stuff. - That's ethical. - You know, the guys with sports cars in Dubai, these people, you know. - Yes. - E-comm like, oh bro, you gotta drop ship. - Yeah. - And you'll make 100 million a month. Those people was this shit. And I was like, this is not my people. - Yeah, I mean there's nothing wrong with any of those individual components. - No, no judgment. - But there's a foundation that's not quite ethical. What is that? I don't know what that is, but yeah, I get you. - No, I don't wanna judge. I noted for me, it wasn't my world, it wasn't my subculture. I wanted to make cool shit. But they also think their shit is cool. But I wanted to make real startups and that was my thing. I would read Hacker News, like Y Combinator, and they were making cool stuff. So I wanted to make cool stuff. - I mean, that's a pretty cool way of life. Just if you romanticize it for a moment. - It's very romantic man. It's colorful. If I think about the memories. - What are some happy memories? Just like working, working in cafes or working in just the freedom that envelopes you from that way of life, 'cause anything is possible, you can just get off of. - I think it was amazing. We would work. I would make friends and we would work until 6:00 AM in Bali, for example, with Andre, my best friend was still my best friend and another friend, and we would work until the morning when the sun came up. Because at night, the coworking space was silence. There was nobody else. And I would wake up 6:00 PM or 5:00 PM. I would drive to the coworking space on a motorbike. I would buy 30 hot lattes from a cafe. - How many? - 30. 'Cause there was like six people coming or we didn't know. Sometimes people would come in. - Did you say three, zero, 30? - Yeah. - Nice. - And we would drink like four per person or something. - Yeah. - Man, it's Bali. I don't know if they were powerful lattes, but they were lattes and we'd put 'em in a plastic bag and then we'd drive there and all the coffee was like falling everywhere. - [Lex] Yeah. - And then we'd go negotiate and have these coffees here and we'd work all night. We'd play like techno music, and everybody would just work in there. This was literally like business people. They would work in their startup and we'd all try and make something. And then the sun would come up and the morning people, the yoga, yoga girls and yoga guys would come in after the yoga class at six, and they'd say, "Hey, good morning." And we're like, we look like this. - Yeah. - And we're like, what's up, how are you doing? And we didn't know how bad we looked, but it was very bad. And then we'd go home, sleep in a hostel or a hotel and do the same thing and again and again and again. And it was this lock-in mode, like working. And that was very fun. - So it's just a bunch of you techno music blasting all through the night, yeah. - More like (imitates techno music) Like industrial. - Rap chase. - Not like this cheesy. - For me, it's such an interesting thing because the speed of the beat affects how I feel about a thing. - Yeah. - So the faster it is, the more anxiety I feel. But that anxiety is channeled into productivity. But if it's a little too fast, the anxiety overpowers that. - So you don't like drum bass music? - No, probably not. - No, it's too fast. - I mean, for working, I have to play with it. - Yeah. - It's like you can actually, I can adjust my- - Yeah. - Level of anxiety. There's a must be a better word than anxiety. It's like productive anxiety that I like. - Yeah. - Whatever that is. - It also depends what kind of work you do, right? If you're writing, you probably don't want drum bass music. I think for codes like industrial techno, this kind of stuff, kind of fast. It works well, 'cause you really get locked in and combined with caffeine, you go deep. - (laughs) Yeah. - And I think you balance on this edge of anxiety, 'cause this caffeine is also hitting your anxiety. And you want to be on the edge of anxiety with this techno running. Sometimes it gets too much. It's like stop the techno, stop the music is like, but those are good memories. And also like travel memories. You go from city to city. - Yeah. - And it feels like, it's kinda like jet set life. It's feels very beautiful. You're seeing a lot of cool cities. - What was your favorite place that you remember, you visited? - I think still Bangkok is the best place. And Bangkok and Chiang Mai. I think Thailand is very special. I've been to the other place. I've been to Vietnam and I've been to South America and stuff. I still think Thailand wins in how nice people are. How easy of a life people have there. - Everything is cheap. - Yeah. - And good. - Well, Bangkok is getting expensive now, but Chiang Mai is still cheap. I think when you're starting out. It's a great place. Man, the air quality sucks. It's a big problem. And it's quite hot. But that's a very cool place. - [Lex] Pros and cons. - I love Brazil also. My girlfriend is Brazilian. Not just because of that, but I like Brazil. The problem still is the safety issue. It's like in America, like it's localized. It's hard for Europeans to understand. Safety is localized to specific areas. So if you go to the right areas, it's amazing. Brazil is amazing. If you go to wrong areas, maybe you die. Right? - Yeah. Yeah, I mean that's true. - But it's not true in Europe. In Europe it's much more- - That's true. That's true. - More average. - You're right, you're right. It's more averaged out. - Yeah. - I like it when there's strong neighborhoods, when you're like, you cross a certain street and you're in a dangerous part of town. - Man, yeah. - I like it. I like there's certain cities in the United States like that. - Yeah. - I like that. And you're saying Europe is more about that. - But you don't feel scared? - Well, I don't, I like danger. - Well, you BJJ. - No, not even just that. I think dangers interesting. - Yeah. - Danger reveals something about yourself, about others. Also, I like the full range of humanity. - Yeah. - So I don't like the mellowed out aspects of humanity. - I have friends like, nomad friends that are exactly like this. They go to the kind of broken areas. They like this reality. They like the authenticity more. They don't like luxury. They don't like- - Oh, yeah, I hate luxury. - Yeah. - Yeah. - It's very European view, right? (laughs) - Wait, was that? (Lex and Pieter laughs) That's a whole nother conversation. - Yeah. - So you quoted Freya Stark quote, "To awaken quite alone in a strange town is one of the most pleasant sensations in the world." - Yeah. - Do you remember a time you had woken in a strange town and felt like that? We're talking about small towns or big towns or? - Man, anywhere. I think I wrote it in some blog posts and like... It was a common thing when you would wake up and this was like... I have this website. I started a website about this digital nomads, called nomadlist.com. And this was a community, so it was like 3,000 other digital nomads, 'cause I was feeling lonely. So I built this website and I stopped feeling lonely. I started organizing meetups and making friends and it was very common that people would say, they would wake up and they would forget where they are. - Yeah. - For the first half minute. And I had to look outside like, where am I? Which country? Which sounds really like privileged, but it was more like funny. You literally don't know where you are because you're so disrooted. But there's something... Man, it's like Anthony Bourdain. There's something pure about this kinda vagabond travel thing. It's behind me, I think. Now I travel with my girlfriend, right? It's very different. But it is a romantic, memories of this kind of like vagabond, individualistic solo life. But the thing, it didn't make me happy, but it was very cool. But it didn't make me happy, right? It made me anxious. - There's something about it that make you anxious. I don't know, I still feel like that, it's a cool feeling. It's scary at first, but then you realize where you are. I don't know, it's like you awaken to the possibilities of this place- - That's it. - When you feel like that. - That's it. - That's great. And it's even when you're doing some basic travel. - [Pieter] Yeah. - Go to San Francisco or something else. - Yeah, you have like the novelty effect. You're in a new place. Here things are possible. You don't get bored yet. And that's why people get addicted to travel. - Back to startups. You wrote a book on how to do this thing and gave a great talk on it, how to do startups. The book is called "Make: Bootstrapper's Handbook." - Yeah. - I was wondering if you could go through some of the steps. It's idea, build, launch, grow, monetize, automate, and exit. There's a lot of fascinating ideas in each one. So idea stage. - Yeah. - How do you find a good idea? - So I think you need to be able to spot problems. So for example, you can go in your daily life, when you wake up and you're like, what are stuff that I'm really annoyed with? In my daily life that doesn't function well, and that's a problem that you can see. Okay, maybe that's something I can add, write code about, code for and it will make my life easier. So I would say make like a list of all these problems you have and like an idea to solve it, and see which one is like viable. You can actually do something and then start building it. - So that's a really good place to start. Become open to all the problems in your life. Like actually start noticing them. - Yeah. - I think that's actually not a true real thing to do, to realize that some aspects of your life could be done way, way better. - Yeah. - Because we kinda very quickly get accustomed to discomforts. - [Pieter] Exactly. - Like for example, like doorknobs. - [Pieter] Yeah. - Design of certain things. (laughs) - I knew you like scream and doorknob. - Yeah. - 50 tons. - Well, that one I know how much incredible design work has gone into. It's a really interesting. - Yeah. - Doors and doorknobs. Just the design of everyday things. - Yeah. - Forks and spoons. It's gonna be hard to come up with a fork that's better than the current- - Yeah. - Fork designs. - Yeah. - And the other aspect of it is you're saying like, in order to come up with interesting ideas, you gotta try to live a more interesting life. - Yeah, but that's where travel comes in. - [Lex] Yeah. - Because when I started traveling, I started seeing stuff in other countries that you didn't have in Europe, for example, or America even. If you go to Asia, dude, especially 10 years ago, nobody knew about this WeChats, all these apps that they already had before we had them, these everything apps, right? Now Elon's trying to make X, this everything app like WeChat, same thing. In Indonesia or Thailand, you have one app that you can order food, if you can order groceries, you can order massage, you can order car mechanic. Anything you can think of is in the app. And that stuff, for example, that's called arbitrage. You can go to back to your country and build that same app for your country, for example. So you start seeing problems, you start seeing solutions that other people already did in the rest of the world. And also traveling in general just gives you more problems, 'cause travel is uncomfortable. Airports are horrible. Airplanes are not comfortable either. There's a lot of problems you start seeing, just getting outta your house, you know. - But also you can, I mean in the digital world you can just go into different communities and see what can be improved- - Yes. - In that. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - What specifically is your process of generating ideas? Do you like do idea dumps? Do you have a document where you just keep writing stuff? - Yeah, I used to have like a... 'Cause when I wasn't making money, I was trying to like make this list of ideas to see like, so I need to build... I was thinking statistically already, like I need to build all these things, and one of these will work out probably. So I need to have a lot of things to try. And I did that. Right now I think like, because I already have money, I can do more things based on technology. So for example, AI, when I found out about when Stable Diffusion came or ChatGPT and stuff, all these things were like, I didn't start working with them because I had a problem. I had no problems. But I was very curious about technology and I was like playing with it and figuring out like... First just playing with it and then you find something like, okay, this generates... Stable Diffusion generates houses very beautiful and interiors. - So it's less about problem solving, it's more about the possibilities of new things you can create. - Yeah, but that's very risky because that's the famous like solution trying to find a problem. - Yeah. - And usually, it doesn't work. And that's very common with startup funds. I think they have tech, but actually people don't need the tech, right? - Can you actually explain, it'd be cool to talk about some of the stuff you've created. Can you explain the photoai.com? - Yeah, yeah, so it's like fire your photographer. The idea is like, you don't need a photography anymore. You can train yourself as AI model and you can take as many photos as you want anywhere in any clothes with facial expressions, like happy or sad, or poses, all this stuff. - So how does it work? - Yeah. - (laughs) You send me. - So you could press- - A link to a gallery of ones done on me. - Yeah. - Which is? - So on the left you have the prompt, the box. Yeah, so you can write like, so model is your model, this Lex Fridman. - Yeah. - So you can write like model as a blah, blah, blah, whatever you want. - Yep. - Then press the button and it will take photos. It will take one minute. - Photos, what are you using for the hosting for the compute? - Replicate. - Okay. - Replicate.com. They're very, very good. - Okay, it's cool like this interface wise. It's cool that you're showing how long it's gonna take. This is amazing. So I'm presuming you just loaded in a few pictures from the internet. - Yeah, so I went to Google Images, typed in Lex Fridman. I added like 10 or 20 images. You can open 'em in the gallery, and you can use your cursor to, yeah. So some don't look like you, so the hit and miss rate is like, I don't know, I'd say like 50/50 or something. - But when I was watching it tweet, like it's been getting better and better and better. - It was very bad in the beginning. It was so bad. But still people sign up to it, you know. - (laughs) There's two Lex is great. It is getting more and more sexual. It's making me very uncomfortable. - Man, but that's the problem with these models. 'cause (Lex laughs) we need to talk about this, 'cause the models- - I'm sure. - In Stable Diffusion. - Yeah. - So the photo realistic models that are like fine tunes. - [Lex] Yeah. - They were all trained on porn in the beginning. And it was a guy called Hassan. So I was trying to figure out how to do photo realistic AI photos. Stable Diffusion by itself is not doing that well. The faces look all mangled. - Yep. - And it doesn't have enough resolution or something to do that well. But I started seeing these base models, these fine models and people would train on porn and I would try them and they would be very photorealistic. They would have bodies that actually made sense like body anatomy. But if you look at the photo realistic models that people use now, still, there's still core of porn there, of naked people. - Yeah. - So I need to prompt out the naked and everyone needs to do this with AI startups, with imaging. You need to prompt out the naked stuff. You need to put a naked- - You have to keep reminding the model. You need to put clothes on the thing. - Yeah, don't put naked 'cause it's very risky. I have Google Vision that checks- - Yeah. - Every photo before it's shown to the user to like check for NSFW. - Like the nipple detector. Oh, NSFW detector. - Because the journalists get very angry if they, you know. - If you sexualized. - There was a journalist I think, that would got angry to use this. And it was like, oh, it showed like a nipple, 'cause Google Vision didn't detect it. So that's like these kind of problems you need to deal with, that's what I'm talking about. This is with cats. But look at the cat face. It's also kind of mangled. (Lex laughs) - I'm a little bit disturbed. - Can zoom in on the cat if you want. Yeah, it's a very sad cut. (Lex laughs) It doesn't have a nose. - It doesn't have a nose. Wow. - Man, but this is the problem with AI startup 'cause they all act like it's perfect. This is groundbreaking. But it's not perfect. - Yeah. - It's like really bad half the time. - So if I wanted to sort of update model as? - Yeah, so you remove this stuff and you write whatever you want, like in Thailand or something, or in Tokyo. - In Tokyo? - Yeah. - And then- - You could say like at night with neon lights, you can add more detail to make you. - I'll go in Austin. Do you think you'll know in Texas? - Yeah, Austin. - In Austin, Texas. - With cowboy hats. - In Texas, yeah. - As a cowboy. - As a cowboy. It's gonna go towards the porn direction. Man, I hope not. It's the end of my career. (Pieter and Lex laughs) - Or the beginning, it depends. We can send you a push notification when your photos are done. Yeah, all right, cool. - Yeah, let's see. - Oh, wow. So this whole interface you've built. - Yeah. - This is really well done. - It's so jQuery. - So I still use jQuery. - Yes. - The only one. - Still. - After 10 years. - To this day. You're not the only one, the entire of the web. - Yeah. - This PHP. - PHP and jQuery. Yeah, SQLite. - You're just like one of the top performers from a programming perspective that are still openly talking about it. But everyone's using PHP. Most of the web is still probably PHP and jQuery. - I think 70%, 'cause of WordPress, right? 'Cause the blogs are- - Yeah, that's true. - Yeah. - That's true. - I'm seeing a revival now. People are getting sick of frameworks. Like all the JavaScript frameworks are so like, what do you call it? Like wieldy, so it takes so much work to just maintain this code and then it updates to a new version. You need to change everything. PHP just stays the same and works. - Yeah, can you actually just speak to that stack? You build all your websites, apps, startups, projects, all of that with mostly vanilla HTML. - [Pieter] Yeah, yeah.. - JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, and SQLite. And so that's a really simple stack, and you get stuff- - Yeah. - Done really fast. Can you just speak to the philosophy behind that? - I think it's accidental, 'cause that's the thing I knew, like I knew PHP, I knew HTML, CSS, 'cause you make websites and when my startups started taking off, I didn't have time to... I remember putting on my to-do list like learn Node.js, 'cause it's important to switch, 'cause- - Yeah. - This obviously is much better language than PHP, and I never learned it. I never did it, 'cause I didn't have time. These things were growing like this, and I was launching more project and I never had time. It's like one day, I'll start coding properly and I never got to it. - I sometimes wonder if I need to learn that stuff. It's still to do for me to really learn Node.js or Flask or these kind of- - React. - Yeah, React. It feels like a responsible software engineer should know how to use these, but you can get stuff done so fast with vanilla versions of stuff. - Yeah, it's like software developers if you wanna get a job and it's like, you know, people making stuff like startups and if you want to be entrepreneur probably maybe shouldn't, right? - I wonder if there's like, I really wanna measure performance and speed. I think there's a deep wisdom in that. - Yeah. - I do think that frameworks and just constantly wanting to learn the new thing that's complicated way of software engineering gets in the way. I'm not sure what to say about that because definitely like you shouldn't build everything from just vanilla JavaScript or vanilla C, for example. - Yeah. - C++ when you're building systems engineering is like, there's a lot of benefits for a pointer safety and all that kind of stuff. So I don't know, but it just feels like you can get so much more stuff done if you don't care about how you do it. - Man, this is my most controversial take, I think, and maybe I'm wrong, but I feel like there's frameworks now that raise money. They raise a lot of money. They raise 50 million, 100 million, $30 million. And the idea is that you need to make the developers, the new developers, like when you're 18 or 20 years old, right? Get them to use this framework and add a platform to it. Where the framework can... It's open source, but you probably should use the platform which is paid to use it. And the cost of the platforms to host it are a thousand times higher than just hosting it on a simple AWS server or a VPS on DigitalOcean, right? So there's obviously like a monetary incentive here. We wanna get a lot of developers to use this technology and then we need to charge them money 'cause they're gonna use it in startups and then the starters can pay for the bills. It kind of destroys the information out there about learning to code because they pay YouTubers, they pay influencers, developer influencers is a big thing to like... And same thing what happens with like nutrition and fitness or something. Same thing happens in developing, they pay this influencer to promote this stuff, use it, make stuff with it, make demo products with it. And then a lot of people are like, "Wow, use this." And I started noticing this 'cause when I would ship my stuff, people would ask me, "What are you using?" I would say, "Just PHP, jQuery, why does it matter?" And people would start kind of attacking me like, "Why are you not using this new technology, this new framework, this new thing?" And I say, "I don't know, 'cause this PHP thing works and I'm optimizing for anything, it just works." And I never understood like why, I understand there's new technologies that are better and there should be improvement, but I'm very suspicious of money. Just like lobbying. There's money in this developer framework scene. There's hundreds of millions that goes to ads or influencer or whatever. It can't all go to developers. You don't need so many developers for a framework, and it's open source. To make a lot of more money on these startups. - So that's a really good perspective. But in addition to that is like, when you say better, it's like, can we get some data on the better? (Pieter laughs) Because I wanna know from the individual developer perspective and then from a team of five, team of 10, team of 20 developers- - Yeah. - Measure how productive they are in shipping features. How many bugs they create, how many security holes result. - PHP was not good with security for a while, but now it's good. - In theory, in theory- - Yeah. - Is it though? - Now it's good. - No, now as you're saying it, I wanna know if that's true because PHP was just the majority- - Yeah. - Of websites on the internet. - [Pieter] Could be true. - Is it just overrepresented? Same with WordPress? - Yeah. - Yes, there's a reputation that WordPress has a gigantic number of security holes. I don't know if that's true. I know it gets attacked a lot because it's so popular. - [Pieter] Yeah. - It definitely does have security holes, but maybe a lot of other systems have security holes as well. Anyway, I just sort of questioning the conventional wisdom that keeps wanting to push software engineers towards frameworks, towards complex. - [Pieter] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - Like super complicated sort of software engineering approaches that stretch out the time it takes to actually build a thing. - Man, 100%. And it's the same thing with big corporations. 80% of the people don't do anything. It's like- - Right. - It's not efficient. Your benchmark is like people building stuff that actually gets done and like for society, right? If we wanna save time, we should probably use technology that's simple, that's pragmatic, that works, that's not overly complicated. It doesn't make your life like a living hell. - And use a framework one that obviously solves a problem, a direct problem that you- - Of course, yeah, of course. I'm not saying you should code without a framework. You should use whatever you want. Yeah, think it's suspicious. (Lex laughs) And I think it's suspicious. When I talk about it on the Twitter, there's this army comes out. - Yeah. - There's these framework armies. - [Lex] Yeah. - Man, something... My gut tells me. - I wanna ask the framework army, what have they built this week? It's the Elon question. What did you do this week? - Yeah, did you make money with it? Did you charge users? Is it a real business? Yeah. - So going back to the cowboy. - First of all, some never look like you, right? But some do. - Every aspect of this is pretty incredible. I'm also just looking at the interface. It's really well done. So this is all just jQuery. - Yeah. - This is really well done. So take me through the journey of Photo AI. Most of the world doesn't know much about Stable Diffusion or any of this- - Yeah. - Any of the generative AI stuff. And so you're thinking, okay, how can I build cool stuff with this? - [Pieter] Yeah. - So what was the origin story of Photo AI? - I think it started, 'cause Stable Diffusion came out. So Stable Diffusion is like this- - Yeah. - The first like generative image model, AI model. And I started playing with it, like you could install it on your Mac, somebody forked it and made it work for MacBooks. So I downloaded it and cloned the Repo, started using it to generate images and it was like amazing. I found it on Twitter because you see things happen on Twitter and I would post what I was making on Twitter as well and you could make any image, you could write a prompt. So essentially write a prompt and then it generates a photo of that or image of that in any style. They would use like artist names to make like a Picasso kind of style and stuff. And I was trying to see like what is it good at? Is it good at people? No, it's really bad at people, but it was good at houses. So architecture, for example, I would generate like architecture houses. So I made a website called thishousedoesnotexist.org. And it generated like, they called it like house porn at that one. (Lex laughs) House porn is like a subreddit. And this was Stable Diffusion like the first version. So it looks really... You can click for another photo. So it generates all these kind of non-existing houses. - It is house porn. - But it looked kind of good. Especially back then. - It looks really good. - Now things look much better. - That's really, really well done. Wow. - And it also generates like a description. - And you can upvote. Is it nice? - Yeah. - Upvote it. - Yeah. - Man, there's so much to talk to you about. Like the choices here. (Pieter chuckles) It's really well done. - This is very scrappy. In the bottom, there's like a ranking of the most upvoted houses. So these are the top vote. And if you go to old time, you see quite beautiful ones. Yeah, so this one is my favorite. The number one, it's kinda like a. - How is this not more popular? - It was really popular for like a while, but then people got so bored of it, I think, 'cause I was getting bored of it too. Just continuous house porn. Everything starts looking the same. But then I saw it was really good at interior, so I pivoted to interiorai.com where I tried to like upload first generate interior designs. And then I tried to do like, there was a new technology called Image to Image where you can input an image, like a photo, and it would kind of modify the thing. So you see it looks almost the same as Photo AI. It's the same code essentially. - Nice. - So I would upload a photo of my interior where I lived, and I would ask like change this into like a, I don't know, like maximalist design. And it worked and it worked really well. So I was like, okay, this is a startup, 'cause obviously interior design AI, and nobody's doing that yet. So I launched this and I was successful and made like within a week, made 10K, 20K a month, and now still makes like 40K, 50K a month. And it's been like two years. So then I was like, how can I improve this interior design? I need to start learning fine tuning. And fine tuning is where you have this existing AI model and you fine tune it on a specific goal you wanted to do. So I would find really beautiful interior design, make a gallery and train a new model that was very good at interior design. And it worked and I used that as well. And then for fun, I uploaded photos of myself, and here's where it happened. And to train myself like, and this would never work obviously. And it worked. And actually it started understanding me as a concept. So my face worked, and you could do like different styles, me as like very cheesy, medieval warrior, all this stuff. So I was like, this is another startup. So now I did avatarai.me. I couldn't get to.com And this was- - This still up? - Yeah, avatarai.me. Well, now it's forwards to photo AI, 'cause it pivoted. - Got it. - But this was more like cheesy thing. So this is very interesting 'cause this went so viral. It made like, I think 150K in a week or something. So most money I ever made. And then big, this is very interesting, the big VC companies like Lenze, which are much better at iOS and stuff than me, I didn't have iOS app. They quickly built an iOS app that does the same. And they found technology, and it's all open technology. So it's good. And I think they made like $30 million with it. - [Lex] Yeah. - They became like the top grossing app after that. - How do you feel about that? - I think it's amazing, honestly. And it's not like- - You didn't have like a feeling like, ah, fuck. - No, I was a little bit like sad, 'cause all my products would work out and I never had like real fierce competition. And now I have fierce competition from like a very skilled high talent. I was developer studio or something that, and they already had an app. They had an app, an App Store for like, I think retouching your face or something. So they were very smart. They add these avatars to there. It's a feature. They had the users, they do a push notification to everybody. We have this avatars. - Yeah. - Man, they create, I think they made so much money. I think they did a really great job. And I also made a lot of money with it. But I quickly realized it wasn't my thing, 'cause it was so cheesy. It was like Kitch, it's kind of like me as a Barbie or me as a... - Yeah. - It was too cheesy. I wanted to go for like, what's a real problem we can solve? 'Cause this is gonna be a hype. This is gonna be, and it was a hype, these avatars. It's like let's do real photography. How can you make people look really photo realistic? And it was difficult. And that's why these avatars work, 'cause they were all like in a cheesy Picasso style, and art is easy 'cause you interpret... All the problems that AI has with your face are like artistic. If you call it Picasso. But if you make a real photo, all the problems with your face, you look wrong. So I started making Photo AI, which was like a pivot of it where it was like a photo studio where you could take photos without actually needing, a photographer, needing a studio. You just type it. And I've been working on it for like the last year. - Yeah, it's really incredible. That journey is really incredible. Let's go to the beginning of Photo AI though, 'cause I remember seeing a lot of really, (laughs) really hilarious photos. I think you were using yourself as a case study. Right? - Yeah. - Yeah, so there's a tweet here. Sold $100,000 in AI generated avatars. - Yeah, and it's a lot like, it's a lot for anybody. It's a lot for me. (Lex laughs) Making 10K a day on this, you know. - That's amazing. That's amazing. - And then the nested tweet, like that's the launch tweet, and then the before that it's like the me hacking on it. - Oh, I see. So that... Okay, so October 26th, 2022. - Yeah. - I trained an ML model on my face. - Because my eyes are quite far apart. I learned when I did YouTube, I would put a photo of like my DJ photo, my mixture. And people would say I look like a hammerhead shark. It was like the top comment. So then I realized my eyes are far apart. - Yeah, the internet helps you figure out who you look like. - Yeah, helps realize how you look. - Boy, do I love the internet. - So first trap. - Well what is, is this? Wait. - It's water from the waterfall, but the waterfalls in the back, you know, so what's going on? - So how much of this is real? - It's all AI. - It's all AI. - Yeah. - That's pretty good, though, for the early days. - Exactly. But this was hit or miss, so you had to do a lot of curation, 'cause 99% of it was really bad. So these are the photos I uploaded. - How many photos did you use? Only these, I will try more up to date picks later. These are the only photos you uploaded? - Yeah, yeah. - Wow. Wow, okay, so you were learning all this super quickly. - [Pieter] Yeah. - What are some interesting details you remember from that time for what you had to figure out to make it work? And for people just listening, he uploaded just a handful of photos that don't really have a good capture of the face. And he is able to- - I think it's cropped, it's like a cropped by the layout. But they're square photos. So they're 512 by 512, because that's Stable Diffusion. - But nevertheless not great capture the face. - Yeah. - It's not like a collection of several hundred photos that are like 360 overview. - Exactly. I would imagine that too when I started I was like, oh, this must be like some 3D scan technology, right? - Yeah. - So I think the cool thing with AI, it trains the concept of you. So it's literally like learning, just like any AI model learns, it learns how you look. So I did this and then I was getting DMs, like Telegram messages, how can I do the same thing? I want these photos. My girlfriend wants these photos. So I was like, okay, this is obviously a business, but I didn't have time to code it, make a whole like app about it. So I made a HTML page, registered domain name. It was a Stripe payment link, which means you have literally a link to Stripe to pay, but there's no code in the back. So all you know is you have customers that paid money. Then I added like some a Typeform link. So Typeform is a site where you can create your own input form like Google forms. So they would get a email with a link to the Typeform or actually just a link after the checkout and they could upload their photos. So enter the email, upload the photos and I launched it, and I was like, here first sale, so it's October 2022. And I think within the first 24 hours was like, I'm not sure it was a thousand customers or something. But the problem was I didn't have code to automate this. So I had to do manually. So the first few hundred, I just literally took their photos, train them, and then I would generate the photos with the prompts, and I had this text file with the prompts, and I would do everything manually. And this quickly became way too much. But that's another constraint. I was forced to code something up that would do that. And that was essentially making it into a real website, right? - So at first it was the Typeform and they uploaded through the Typeform. - [Pieter] Stripe checkout platform, yeah. - And then you were like, that image is downloaded. Did you write a script to export downloaded? - No, it downloaded the images myself. It was a zip file, to unzipped the zip file. - Literally, and you unzipped it. One by one. - Yes. No, because you know, do things that don't scale. Paul Graham says, right? And then I would train, and I would email them the photos, I think from my personal email say, "Here's your avatars." And they liked it. They were like, "Wow, it's amazing." - You emailed them with your personal email. - So I didn't have an email address on this- - Yeah. - Domain. - And this is like a hundred people. - Yeah, and then you know who signed up like, man, I cannot say it, but really famous people, like really, really billionaires, famous tech billionaires did it. And I was like, "Wow, this is crazy." And I was like so scared to mess them. So I said, "Thanks so much for using my sites." And he's like, "Yeah, amazing app. Great work." So I was like, this is different than normal reaction. - It's Bill Gates isn't, it? - Cannot say anything. (Lex laughs) - Just like shirtless picks. - GDPR like privacy. - Right, right. - European regulation. - Right. - Cannot share anything. I was like, wow. But this shows like... So you make something and then if it takes off very fast, you're like, it's validated. You're like, here's something that people really want. But then also thought, this is a hype, this is gonna die down very fast, and it did because it's too cheesy. - But you had to automate the whole thing. How'd you automate it? So what's the AI component? How hard was that to figure out? - Okay, so that's actually in many ways the easiest thing, 'cause there is all these platforms already back then. There was platforms for fine tune, Stable Diffusion. Now I use Replicate, back then I use different platforms, which was funny 'cause that platform when this thing took off, I would tweet, 'cause I tweet always like how much money these websites make. You call it vendor, right? The platform that did the GPUs, they increased their price for training from $3 to $20. After they saw that I was making so much money. So immediately my profit is gone, 'cause I was selling them for $30 and I was in a Slack with them like saying, "What is this?" Can you just put it back to $3? They say, "Yeah, maybe in the future, we're looking at it right now." I'm like, "What are you talking about?" You just took all my money, and they're smart. - Well, they're not that smart because like you also have a large platform and a lot of people respect you. So you can literally come out and say that. - I think it's like kind of dirty to cancel a company or something. I prefer just bringing my business elsewhere. But there was no elsewhere- - Right. - Back then. - [Lex] Right. - So I started talking to other AI model, ML platforms. So Replicate was one of those platforms. And I started DMing, the CEO say, "Can you please create," it's called Dream Booth, this fine tuning of yourself. Can you add this to your site? 'Cause I need this, 'cause I'm being price guard. And he said "No, because it takes too long to run. It takes half an hour to run, and we don't have the GPUs for it." I said, "Please, please, please, and then after a week he said, "We're doing it, we're launching this." And then this company became, it was like not very famous company. It became very famous with this stuff, 'cause suddenly everybody was like, oh, we can build similar apps like avatar apps. And everybody started building avatar apps and everybody started using Replicate for it. And it was from these early DMs with like the CEO, like Ben Firshman. Very nice guy. And he was like, they never prized media. They never treated me bad. They always been very nice. It's a very cool company. So you can run any AI model, LLMs, you can run on here. - And you can scale? - Yes, they scale, yeah, yeah. And I mean you can do now, you can click on the model and just run it already. It's like super easy. You log in with GitHub. - That's great. - And by running it on the website, then you can automate with the API, you can make a website that runs the model. - Generate images, generate text, generate videos, generate music, generate speech. - Video. - Fine tune models. - They do anything, yeah. It's a very cool company. - Nice. And you're like growing with them, essentially. They grew because of you, because it's like a big use case. - Yeah, the website even looks weird now. It started as a machine learning platform that was like, I didn't even understand what it did. It was just too ML. You would understand 'cause you're in the ML world. I wouldn't understand - Now it's newb friendly. - Yeah, exactly. (Lex laughs) And I didn't know how it worked but I knew that they could probably do this and they did it. They built the models and now I use them for everything. And we trainedlike, I think now 36,000 models, 36,000 people already. - But is there some tricks to fine tuning to like the collection of photos that are provided? - Yes. - Like how do you? - Yes, man, there's so many hacks. - The hacks. - Yeah, it's like 100 hacks to make it work. (Lex and Pieter laughs) - It get my secrets now. - Well, not the secrets, but the more like, insights maybe about the human face and the human body. What kind of stuff get messed up a lot? - I think people, well man, as a living, people don't know how they look. - [Lex] Yeah. - They generate photos of themselves and then they say, "Ah, it doesn't look like me." - [Lex] Yeah. - You can check the training photos. It does look like you. - Yeah. - But you don't know how you look. So there's a face dysmorphia of yourself that you have known idea how you look. - Yeah, that's hilarious. I mean I've got to one of the least pleasant activities in my existence is having to listen to my voice and look on my face. So I get to like really, really have to sort of come into terms with the reality of how I look and how I sound. - Man, everybody. - But people often don't, right? - Really? - You have a distorted view perspective. - I know that like if I would make a selfie how I think I look that, that's nice. Other people think that's not nice. But then they make a photo of me, I'm like that's super ugly. But then they're like, no, that's how you look. And you look nice. So how other people see you is nice. So you need to ask other people to choose your photos. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - You shouldn't choose them yourself 'cause you don't know how you look. - Yeah, you don't know what makes you interesting, what makes you attractive or all this kind of stuff. - Yeah, exactly. - And a lot of us, this is dark aspect of psychology. We focus on some small flaws. - Yeah. - This is why I hate plastic surgery, for example. - Yeah. - People try to remove the flaws when the flaws are the thing that makes you interesting and attractive. - I learned from the hammerhead shark eyes this, the stuff about you that looks ugly to you. And it's probably what makes you, original makes you nice and people like it about you. - [Lex] Yeah. - And it's not like, oh my god. And people notice it. People notice your hammerhead eyes. But it's like, that's me, that's my face. I love myself. And that's confidence, and confidence is attractive. - Yes. - Right? - Confidence is attractive. But yes, understanding what makes you beautiful. It's the breaking of symmetry makes you beautiful. It's the breaking of the average face makes you beautiful. All that. - Yeah. - And obviously different from men and women, a different age. It's all this kind of stuff. - Yeah, 100%. - But underneath it all the personality, all of that. When the face comes alive, that also is the thing that makes you beautiful. - Yeah. - But anyway, you have to figure all that out with AI. - Yeah, one thing that worked was like people would upload full body photos themselves. So I would crop the face, right? And then the model knew better that we're training mostly the face here. But then I started losing resemblance of the body, 'cause some people are skinny, some people are muscular, whatever. So you want to have that too. So now I mix full body in the training with face photos, face crops, and it's all automatic. And I know that other people, they use again AI models to detect like what are the best photos in this training set? And then train on those. But it's all about training data and it's with everything in AI. How good your training data is, is in many ways more important than how many steps you train for like how many months or whatever with these GPUs. The goals. - Do you have any guidelines for people of how to get good data? How to give good data to fine tune on? - The photos should be diverse. So for example, if I only upload photos with a brown shirt or green shirts, the model will think that I'm training the green shirts. So the things that are the same every photo are the concepts that are trained. What you want is your face to be the concept that's trained and everything else to be diverse, like different. - So diverse lighting as well, diverse everything. - Yeah, outside, inside. But there's no, like, this is the problem. There's no like manual for this, and nobody knew. We were all just... Especially two years ago, we're all hacking, trying to test anything. Anything you can think of. And it's frustrating. It's one of the most frustrating and also fun and challenging things to do because with AI, 'cause it's a black box. And like Karpathy, I think says this. We don't really know how this thing works, but it does something. But nobody really knows why, right? We cannot look into the model of an LLM, like what is actually in there. We just know it's a 3D matrix of numbers, right? So it's very frustrating, 'cause some things you... You think they're obvious that they will improve things will make them worse. And there's so many parameters you can tweak. So you're testing everything to improve things. - I mean there's a whole field novel of mechanistic interpretability that like studies that tries to figure out, tries to break things apart and understand how it works. But there's also the data side and the actual like consumer facing product side of figuring out how you get it to generate a thing that's beautiful or interesting or naturalistic, all that kind of stuff. - Yeah. - And you're like at the forefront of figuring that out about the human face. - Yeah. - And humans really care about the human face. - They're very vain. (Lex laughs) - Like me, I want to look good on your podcast- - Yeah. - For example. - Yeah, for sure. - And then one of the things I actually would love to like rigorously use Photo AI, because for the thumbnails, I take portraits of people. I don't a shit about photography. I basically used your approach for photography. I like Google. How do you take photographs? - Yeah. - Camera, lighting. And also it's tough because maybe you could speak to this also, but with photography, no offense, Danny, they're true artists, great photographers. But people take themselves way too seriously. Think you need a whole lot of equipment. You definitely don't want one light, you need like five lights. - Man, I know this. - And you have to have like the lenses. And I talked to a guy, an expert of shaping the sound in a room, okay? Because I was thinking, I'm gonna do a podcast studio, whatever, I should probably treat, do a sound treatment on the room. And when he showed up and analyzed the room, he thought everything I was doing was horrible. And then that's when I realized like, you know what? I don't need experts in my life. - You kick him outta the house. - No, I didn't kick them. I mean, I said thank you, thank you very much. - Thank you. Great tips, bye. - I just felt like there is... Focus on whatever the problems are. Use your own judgment, use your own instincts. Don't listen to other people, and only consult other people when there's a specific problem. And you consult them, not to offload the problem onto them, but to gain wisdom from their perspective. Even if their perspective is ultimately one you don't agree with, you're gonna gain wisdom from that. I ultimately come up with like a PHP solution. PHP and jQuery solution- - PHP studio. - PHP studio. I have a little suitcase, I use just the basic sort of consumer type of stuff. One light, it's great. - Yeah, and look at you, you're like one of the top podcasts in the world and you get millions of views and it works. And the people that spend so much money on optimizing for the best sound for the best studio, they get like 300 views. So what is this about? This is about that either you do really well or also that a lot of these things don't matter. What matters is probably the content of the podcast. - [Lex] Yeah. - You get the interesting guests - Focus on stuff that matters. - Yeah, and I think that's very common. They call it Gear Acquisition Syndrome. Guests, like people in any industry do this, they just buy all the stuff. There was a meme recently. What's the name for the guy that buys all the stuff before he even started doing the hobby, right? Marketing. Marketing does that to people. They wanna buy this stuff. - Yeah. - But like, man, you can make a Hollywood movie on an iPhone. If the content is good enough, and it will probably be original because you would be using an iPhone for it. - That said, so the reason I brought that up with photography. There is wisdom from people and one of the things I realized, you probably also realized this, but how much power light has to convey emotion. Just take one light and move it around. See you're sitting in the darkness, move it around your face. The different positions are having a second light potentially, you can play with how a person feels just from a generic face. - Yeah. - It's interesting. You can make people attractive, you can make 'em ugly, you can make them scary, you can make them lonely. All of this. - Yeah. - And so you kind of start to realize this. And I would definitely love AI help in creating great portraits of people. - Guest photos, yeah. - Guest photos, for example. That's a small use case. But for me, I suppose it's an important use case because I want people to look good but I also wanna capture who they are. Maybe my conception of who they are, what makes them beautiful. - Yeah. - What makes their appearance powerful in some ways. Sometimes it's the eyes, oftentimes it's the eyes, but there's certain features of the face can sometimes be really powerful. It's also kind of awkward for me to take. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Photographs. So I'm not collecting enough. - Yeah. - Photographs for myself to do it with just those photographs. If I can load that off onto AI and then start to play with lighting all that stuff. - Man, you should do, and you should probably do it yourself. You can use Photo AI, but it's even more fun if you do it yourself. So you train models, you can learn about like control nets. Control net is where, for example, your photos in your podcast are usually like from the angle, right? So you can create a control net face post that's always like this. So every model, every photo you generate uses this control net photos, for example. I think would be very fun for you to try out that something. - Do you play with lighting at all? Do you play with lighting, with pose with the? - Man, actually, like this week or recently, there's some new model came out that can adjust the light of any photo. But also AI image with Stable Diffusion. I think it's called Relight. And it's amazing. You can upload kinda like a light map. So for example, red, purple, blue, and use the light map to change the light on the photo you input. It's amazing. So there's for sure a lot of stuff you can do. - What's your advice for people in general on how to learn all this state-of-the-art AI tools available? You mentioned the new models coming out all the time. - Yeah. - How do you pay attention? How do you stay on top of everything? - I think you need to join Twitter X. X is amazing now and the whole AI industry is on X, and they're all like anime avatars. So (chuckles) it's funny, 'cause my friends ask me this. Who should I follow to stay up to date? And I say go to X, and follow all the AI anime models that this person is following or follows. And I send them something URL, and they all start laughing like, what is this? But they're real like people hacking around in AI. They get hired by big companies and they're on X, and most of 'em are anonymous. It's very funny. They use anime avatar, I don't, but those people hack around and then they publish what they're discovering. They talk about papers, for example. So yeah, definitely X. - It's great. I almost exclusively all the people I follow are AI people. - Yeah, it's a good time now. - Well, but also just brings happiness to my soul, 'cause there's so much turmoil on Twitter. - Yeah, politics and stuff. - There's battles going on. It's like a war zone, and it's nice to just go into this happy place to where people are building stuff. - Yeah, 100%. I like Twitter for that most like building stuff, like seeing other. 'Cause it inspires you to build and it's just fun to see other people share what they're discovering and then you're like, okay, I'm gonna make something too. It's just super fun. And so if you wanna start going X and then I would go to Replicate, and start trying to play with models. And when you have something that kind of, you manually enter stuff, you set the parameters, something that works, you can make an app out of it or a website. - Can you speak a little bit more to the process of it becoming better and better and better Photo AI. - So I had this Photo AI, and a lot of people using it. There was like a million or more photos a month being generated. And I discovered I was testing parameters like increase the step count of generating a photo or chasing the sampler, like a scheduler. You have DPM++2 Karras all these things I don't know anything about, but I know that you can choose them and you generate image and they have different resulting images. But I didn't know which one were better. So I would do it myself, test it. But then I was like, why dot I test on these users? 'Cause I have a million photos generated anyway. So unlike 10% of the users, I would randomly test parameters, and then I would see if they would, 'cause you can favor the photo or you can download it. I would measure if they favorite or like the photo. And then I would AB test, and you test for significance and stuff, which parameters were were better and which were worse? - So you start starting to figure out which models are actually working well. - Exactly, and then if it's significant enough data, you switch to that for the whole, you know, all the users. And so that was like the breakthrough to make it better. Just use the users to improve themselves. And I tell them when they sign up, we do sampling, we do testing on your photos of random parameters, and that worked really well. I don't do a lot of testing anymore because it's like, I kind of reached a diminishing point where it's like, it's kind of good, but there was a breakthrough, yeah. - So it's really about the parameters, the models that choose and letting the users help do the search in the space of models and parameters for you. - Yeah, yeah. But actually, so like Stable Diffusion, I used 1.52, 2.0 came out as Stable Diffusion Excel came out, all these new versions and they're all worse. And so the core scene of people are still using 1.5 because it's also not like, what do you call neutered? They neutered to make it super like, with safety features and stuff. - Yeah. - So most of the people are still on Stable Diffusion 1.5 and meanwhile Stable Diffusion, the company went like, the CEO left. A lot of drama happened. - Yeah. - Because they couldn't make money, and yeah, so it's very interesting, they gave us this open source model that everybody uses. They raised like hundreds of millions of dollars. They didn't make any money, there are not a lot. And they did amazing job. And now everybody uses open source model for free. It's amazing. It's amazing. - You're not even using the latest one, you're saying? - No, and the strange thing is that this company raised hundreds of millions, but the people that are benefiting from it are really small. People like me who make these small apps that are using the model. And now they're starting to charge money for the new models. But the new models are not so good for people. They're not sell open source, right? - Yeah, it is interesting because open source is so impactful in the AI space, but you wonder like what is the business model behind that? But it's enabling this whole ecosystem of companies that- - [Pieter] Yeah, yeah. - They're using the open source models. - So it's kinda like this frameworks, but then they didn't bribe enough influence to use it, and they didn't charge money for the platform. - Okay, so back to your book and the ideas. We didn't even get to the first step. Generating ideas, so you had notebook, and you're filling it up. How do you know when an idea is a good one? You have this just flood of ideas. How do you pick the one that you actually try to build? - Man, mostly you don't know. Mostly, I choose the ones that are most viable for me to build. I cannot build a space company now, right? It would be quite challenging. But I can build something. - Did you actually write down like space company? - No, I think asteroid mining would be very cool. 'Cause like you go to an asteroid, you take some stuff from there, you bring it back, you sell it, you know. But then you need to do... And you can hire someone to launch the thing. So all you need is like the robot that goes to the asteroid, and the robotic is interesting. I wanna also learn robotics. So maybe that could be. - I think both the asteroid mining and the robotics is- - Yeah. - Together. - I feel like. - No, exactly, this is it. - It says- - We do this not because it's easy, but because we thought it would be easy. Exactly- - Asteroid mining. - That's me with asteroid mining. Exactly. (Lex laughs) That's why I should do this. - It's not nomadlist.com. (laughs) - No, it's not. - It's asteroid mining. You have to like build stuff. Gravity is really hard to overcome. - Yeah, but it seems... Man, I sound like idiots, probably not. But it sounds quite approachable, relatively approachable. You don't have to build a rocket issue. - Oh, you use something like SpaceX to get out the space. - Yeah, you hire SpaceX to send your, you know, this dog robot or whatever. - So is there actually existing notebook where you wrote down asteroid mining? - No, back then I used Trello. - Trello. - Yeah. But now I don't really, I used Telegram. I rather than like saved messages and I have like idea, I write it down. - You type to yourself on Telegram? - 'Cause you use WhatsApp, right? I think, so you have messages to yourself, thing also, yeah, it's like a notepad. - So you're talking to yourself on Telegram. - Yeah, you use like a Notepad, to not forget stuff. And then I pin it. - I love how like you're not using super complicated systems or whatever. People use Obsidian now. There's a lot of these- - A notion where you have systems for note taking. Your notepad, your notepad.exe guy. If you're those user- - Yeah. Man, I saw some YouTubers doing this. There's a lot of these productivity gurus also. And they do this whole iPad with a pencil. And then I also had an iPad and I also got the pencil and I got this app where you can like draw on paper. Like a calendar. - Yeah. - People's students uses and you do coloring and stuff. And I'm like, dude, I did this for a week. And then I'm like, what am I doing in my life? I could just write it as a message to myself and it's good enough. - Speaking of ideas, you shared a tweet explaining why the first idea sometimes might be a brilliant idea. The reason for this you think is the first idea submerges from your subconscious, and was actually boiling your brain for weeks, months, sometimes years in the background. The eight hours of thinking can never compete with a perpetual subconscious background job. So this is the idea that if you think about an idea for eight hours versus like the first idea that pops into your mind. - Yeah. - And sometimes there is subconscious, like stuff that you've been thinking about for many years. That's really interesting. - Yeah, I mean like emerges. I wrote it wrong because I'm not native English, but it emerges from your subconscious, right? It comes from the like a water, your subconscious in here, it's boiling, and then when it's ready it's like ding. It's like a microwave comes out and there you have your idea. - You think you have ideas like that? - Yeah, all the time, 100%. - It's just stuff that's been like there. - Yes. - Yeah. - And also, it comes up and I bring it, I send it back, like send it back to the kitchen- - Not ready yet. - To boil more. - Yeah. - And it's like a soup of ideas that's cooking. It's 100%. This is how my brain works, and I think most people. - But it's also about the timing. Sometimes you have to send it back, not just because you're not ready, but the world is not ready. - Yeah, so many times, startup founders are too early with their idea. Yeah, 100%. - Robotics is an interesting one for that because like there's been a lot of robotics companies that failed. - [Pieter] Yeah. - Because it's been very difficult to build, a robotics company, make money, 'cause there's the manufacturing, like the cost of everything. The intelligence of the robot is enough, is not sufficient to create a compelling enough product from which to make money. So there's this long line of robotics companies that have tried, they had big dreams and they failed. - Yeah, like Boston Dynamics. I still don't know what they're doing, but they always upload YouTube videos, and it's amazing. But I feel like a lot of these companies don't have a, it's like a solution looking for a problem for now. Military obviously use this, do I need like a robotic dog now for my house? I don't know. It's fun, but it doesn't really solve anything yet. I feel the same kinda VR, like it's really cool. Apple Vision Pro is very cool. It doesn't really solve something for me yet. And that's kind of the tech looking for a solution, right? But one day, will. - When the personal computer, when the Mac came along, there's a big switch that happened. It somehow captivated everybody's imagination and like the application, the killer apps became apparent, you can type in a computer. - But take became apparent like immediately. Back then they also had like this thing where like, we don't need these computers. They're like a hype. And it also went like in kinda like waves. - Yeah, yeah, but the hype is the thing that allowed the thing to proliferate sufficiently to where people's minds would start opening up to it a little bit. - Yeah. - The possibility of it. Right now, for example, with the robotics, there's very few robots in the homes of people. - Exactly, yeah. - The robots that are Roombas, so the vacuum cleaners or they're Amazon Alexa. - Yeah, or dishwasher. I mean it's essentially a robot. - Yes, but the intelligence is very limited. - Yeah. - I guess is one way we can summarize all of them. Except Alexa, which is pretty intelligent, but is limited with the kind of ways it interacts with you. That's just one example. - Yeah. - I sometimes think about that as like, if some people in this world were kind of born in the whole existence is like they were meant to build the thing. - Yeah. - I think I sometimes wonder like what I was meant to do. Because you have these plans for your life, you have these dreams. - I think you're meant to build robots. - Okay, me personally. (Pieter and Lex laughs) Maybe, maybe. That's a sense of habit, but it could be other things. It could hilariously not be the thing I was meant to be is to talk to people. - Yeah. - Which is weird, because I always was anxious about talking to people. It's like a- - Really? - Yeah, I'm scared of this. I was scared is (laughs) yeah, exactly. - I'm scared of you as well. (Lex laughs) - It's just anxiety throughout, social interaction in general. I'm an introvert that hides from the world, so yeah. It's really strange. - Yeah, but that's also kinda life. Life brings you to, it's very hard to super intently kind of choose what you're gonna do with your life. It's more like surfing. You're surfing the waves. You go in the ocean, you see where you end up. - Yeah, yeah. And there's universe has a kind of sense of humor. - [Pieter] Yeah. - I guess you have to just, yeah, allow yourself to be carried away by the ways. Yeah. - Exactly, yeah, yeah. - Have you felt that way in your life? - Yeah, all the time. Yeah, I think that's the best way to live your life. - So allow whatever to happen. Do you know what you're doing in the next few years? Is it possible that it'll be completely, like changed? - Possibly. I think relationships, you wanna hold relationships, right? You wanna hold your girlfriend, you wanna become wife and all this stuff. I think you should stay open to where, like for example, where you wanna live. I don't know, we don't know where we wanna live, for example. That's something that will figure itself out. It will crystallize where you will get sent by the waves to somewhere where you only live, for example, what you're gonna do. I think that's a really good way to live your life. I think most stress comes from trying to control, like hold things... It's kind of Buddhist. You need to like lose control, let it loose. And things will happen. When you do mushrooms, when you do drugs, like psychedelic drugs. The people that start, that are like control freaks get bad trips, right? 'Cause you need to let go. I'm pretty control freak actually. When I did mushrooms when I was 17, it was very good. And then at the end it wasn't so good, 'cause I tried to control it was like, ah, now it's going too much. Let's stop. Bro, you can't stop it. You need to go through with it. And I think it's a good metaphor for life. I think that's very tranquil way to lead your life. - Yeah, actually when I took Ayahuasca, that lesson is deeply within me already that you can't control anything. - [Pieter] Yes. - I think I probably learned that the most in jiu-jitsu. So just let go and relax. - Yeah. - And that's why I had just an incredible experience. There's like literally no negative aspect of my Ayahuasca experience or any psychedelics I've ever had. Some of that could be with my biology and my genetics, whatever. But some of it was just not trying to control. - Yeah. - Just surf the wave. - For sure. I think most stress in life comes from trying to control. - So once you have the idea- - Yeah. - Step two, build. How do you think about building the thing once you have the idea? - I think you should build with the technology that you know. So for example, Nomad List, which is like this website I made to figure out the best cities to live and work as digital nomad. It wasn't a website, it launched as a Google spreadsheets. So it was a public Google spreadsheet. Anybody could edit. And I was like, I'm collecting cities where we can live with as nomads, with the internet speeds, the cost of living, other stuff. And I tweeted it, and back then I didn't have a lot of followers. I had like a few thousand followers or something. And I went like viral for my skill viral back then, you know, which was like five retweets. And a lot of people started editing it. And there was like hundreds of cities in this list, from all over the world with all the data. It was very crowdsourced. And then I made that into a website. So figuring out like what technology you can use that you already know. So if you cannot code, you can use a spreadsheet. If you cannot use a spreadsheet, like whatever, you can always use a, for example, a website generator like Wix or something or Squarespace, right? You don't need to code to build a startup. All you need is idea for a product. Build something like a landing page or something. Put a Stripe button on there and then make it. And if you can code, use the language that you already know and start coding with that and see how far you can get. You can always rewrite the code later. The tech stack is not actually, it's not the most important of a business when you're starting on a business. The important thing is that you validate that there's a market, that there's a product that people wanna pay for. So use whatever you can use. And if you cannot code, use spreadsheets, landing page generators, whatever. - Yeah, and the crowdsourcing element is fascinating. It's cool, it's cool when a lot of people start using it. You get to learn so fast. - Yeah. - I've actually did the spreadsheet thing. You share a spreadsheet publicly and I made it editable. - Yeah. - It's so cool. - [Pieter] Interesting things start happening. - Yeah, I did it for like a workout thing, 'cause I was doing a large amount of pushups and pull ups every day. - Yeah, I remember this man, yeah. - (laugh) And well, I had Google Sheets is pretty limited and that everything is allowed. So people could just write anything in any cell and they can create new sheets. - Yeah. - New tabs. And it just exploded. And one of the things that I really enjoyed is there's very few trolls because actually other people would delete the trolls. There would be like this weird war- - Army, yeah. - Of like. They want like to protect the thing. It's an immune system that's inherent to the thing. - It comes to society. - Yeah. - In the spreadsheets. - And then there's the outcast who go to the bottom of the spreadsheet and they would try to hide messages, and they like, I don't wanna be with the cool kids up at the top of the spreadsheet, so I'm gonna at the bottom. - Self-harmonizing. - Yes. - It's insane. - It's fast. I mean, but that kind of crowdsourcing element is really powerful. And if you can create a product that use that to his benefit, that's really nice. Any kind of voting system, any kind of rating system for A and B testing is really- - Yeah. - Really, really fascinating. So anyway, so Nomad List is great. I would love for you to talk about that. But one sort of way to talk about it is through you building Hoodmaps. - Yeah. - So you did an awesome thing, which is document yourself building the thing and doing so in just a handful of days, like three, four, five days. So people should definitely check out the video in the blog post. Can you explain what Hoodmaps is and what this whole- - Yeah. - This process was? - So I was traveling, and I was still trying to find problems, right? I would discover that like everybody's experience of a city is different because they stay in different areas. - Yeah. - So I'm from Amsterdam and when I grew up in Amsterdam or I didn't grow up, but I lived there, in university, I knew that center is like in Europe, the centers are always tourist areas. So they're super busy, they're not very authentic. They're not really Dutch culture, it's Amsterdam tourist culture. So when people would travel to Amsterdam would say, don't go to the center, go to Southeast of the center, Jordaan or the De Pijp or something, more hipster areas. A little more authentic culture of Amsterdam. That's where I would live, and where I would go. And I thought this could be like an app where you can have like a Google maps and you put colors over it. You have areas that are like color code. Red is tourists, green is rich, green money, yellow is hipster. You can figure out where you need to go in the city when you travel, 'cause I was traveling a lot. I wanted to go to the cool spots. - So just use color. - Yeah. Color, yeah. Yeah, and I would use a Canvas. So I thought, okay, what do I need? I need to- - Did you know that you would be using a Canvas? - No, I didn't know it was possible, 'cause I didn't know. - So this is the cool thing. People should really check out. - This is how it started. - Because you're honestly capture so beautifully, the humbling aspects, the embarrassing aspects of like not knowing what to do. It's like how do I do this? And you document yourself. Yeah, you're right. Dude, I feel embarrassed about myself. (laughs) - Oh, really, yeah. - It's called being alive. Nice. So you're like, you don't know anything about, so Canvas is a HTML5 thing that allows you to draw shapes. - Yeah, draw images. Just draw pixels essentially so. - Yeah. - And that was special back then. Because before you could only have like elements, right? So you wanna draw a pixel, use a Canvas. And I knew I needed to draw pixels 'cause I need to draw these colors. And I felt like, okay, I'll get like a Google maps iframe embed, and then I'll put a Dave on top of it with the colors, and I'll do like opacity 50, so it kind of shows. So I did that with Canvas. And then I started drawing, and then I felt like, obviously, other people need to edit this 'cause I cannot draw all these things myself. So I crowdsource it again, and you would draw on the map and then it would send the pixel data to the server. It would put it in the database, and then I would have a robot running like a cron job, which every week would calculate, or every day would calculate. Okay, so Amsterdam Center, there's like six people say, it's tourist, this part of the center, but two people say, it's like hipster. Okay, so the tourist part wins, right? It's just an array. So find the most common value in a little pixel area on a map. So if most people say it's tourists, it's tourists, and it becomes red. And I would do that for all the GPS corners in the world. - Can we just clarify- - Yeah. - As a human that's contributing to this, do you have to be in that location to make the label or do you? - No, people just type in cities and go like, go berserk and start drawing everywhere. - Would they draw shapes or would they draw pixels? - Man, they drew like crazy stuff. Like offensive symbols. I cannot mention they would draw penises. - I mean, that's obviously a guy thing. - I would do the same thing, draw penises. - That's the first thing. (Pieter laughs) When I show up to Mars and there's no cameras, I'm drawing penis on the sand. - Man, I did it in the snow, you know, but the penises did not become a problem, 'cause I knew that not everybody would draw a penis and not in the same place. So most people would use it fairly. So just if I had enough crowdsource data. So you have all these pixels on top of it. It's like a layer of pixels. - Yeah. - And then you choose the most common pixel. So yeah, it's just like a bowl, but in visual format. And it worked and within a week got enough data, and it was like cities that did really well, like Los Angeles, a lot of people started using it. Like most data's in Los Angeles. - Because Los Angeles has defined neighborhoods. - Yeah. - And not just in terms of the official labels, but like what they're known for. - [Pieter] Yeah. - Did you provide the categories that they were allowed to use as labels? - The colors, yeah. - As colors. - So I think you can see there, there's like hipster, tourist, rich, business. There's always a business area, right? And then there's a residential. Residential is gray. So I thought those were the most common things in the city kind of. - And a little bit meme, like it's almost fun to label it as that, right? - Yeah. I mean obviously, it's simplified, but you need to simplify this stuff. You don't wanna have too many categories. And it's essentially just like using a paint brush where you select the color in a bottom, you stick the category and you start drawing. There's no instruction. There's no manual. And then I also added tagging so people could like write something on a specific location. So don't go here or here's like nice cafe and stuff. And man, the memes that came from that. And I also had upvoting, so that the tags could be upvoted. So the memes that came from that is like amazing. People in Los Angeles would write crazy stuff. It would go viral in all these cities. You can allow your location and will probably send you to Austin. - (laughs) Okay, so we're looking, (laughs) oh boy, drunk hipsters. - AirBroNBros. - AirBroNBros. - Gentrifiers. - Hipster girls who do cocaine. - I saw a guy in a fish costume get beaten up here. - Yep, that seems also accurate. - Overpriced and underwhelming. - (laughs) Let me see, let me make sure this is accurate. Let's see. Dirty Sixth for people who know Austin know that that's important to label. Sixth Street is famous in Austin. Dirty Sixth drunk frat boys, accurate. Drunk frat bros. Continued on sixth, very well -known. - West Sixth douchebros. - West Sixth douchebros. - They go from frat to douche. - Douche. I mean it's very accurate so far. - Really. - They only let hot people live here. (laughs) I think that might be accurate. - It's like the district. Exercise freaks on the river. Yeah, that's true. - Dog runners accurate. - Yeah. - Saw a guy in the fish costume get beat up here. - I wanna know the story. - So that's all user contributed. - Yeah, and that's like stuff I couldn't come up with it, 'cause I don't know Austin, I don't know the memes here in the subcultures. - And then me as a user can upload or down vote this. - [Pieter] Yes. - So this is completely crowdsourced. - It's like 'cause of Reddit upvote, downvote, took it from there. - That's really, really, really powerful. Single people with dogs, accurate. At which point did it go from colors to the actually showing the text? - I think I added the text like a week after. And so here's like the pixels. - So that's really cool. The pixels, how do you go from that? That's a huge amount of data. - Yeah. - Now looking at an image where it's just a sea of pixels that call it different colors. - Yeah. - In a city. So how do you combine that to be a thing that actually makes it some sense? - I think here the problem was that you have this data, but it's like it's not locked to one location. - Yeah. - So I had to normalize it. So when you click, when you draw on a map, it will show you the specific pixel location and you can convert the pixel location to a GPS coordinate, right? Like latitude, longitudes. But the number will have a lot of commas or a lot of decimals, right? Because it's very specific, it's like this specific part of the table. So what you wanna do is you wanna take that pixel and you wanna normalize it by removing like decimals, which I discovered, so you're talking about this neighborhood, or this street, right? And so that's what I did. I just took the decimals off and then I saved it like this. And then it starts going to like a grid. And then you have like a grid of data. You get like a pixel map kind of. - And then you said it looks kind of ugly, so then you smooth it. - Yeah, I started adding blurring and stuff. I think now it's not smooth again, 'cause I liked it better. People like the pixel look kinda. Yeah, a lot of people use it and it keeps going viral. And every time my maps bill like Mapbox, I had to stop using... You first use Google Maps, it went viral, and Google Maps, it was out of credits. It's so funny, when I launched it, it went viral. Google Maps, the map didn't load anymore. It says over the limits, you need to contact enterprise sales. But I need now like a map. And I don't wanna contact enterprise sales. I don't wanna go on a call schedule with some calendar. So I switched to Mapbox, and then had Mapbox for years, and then it went viral and I had a bill of $20,000 was like last year. So they helped me with the bill. They said, "You can pay less." And then I now switched to like a open source kind of map platform. So it's a very expensive product and never made any dollar money. But it's very fun. But it's very expensive. - What do you learn from that? So like from that experience, 'cause when you leverage somebody else's through the API. - Yeah, I mean I don't think a map hosting service should cost this much. But I could host it myself, but that would be... I dunno how to do that, but I could do that. - Yeah, it's super complicated. - I think that the thing is more about like, you can't make money with this project. I tried to do many things to make money with it and it hasn't worked. You talked about like possibly doing advertisements on it or some somehow. - [Pieter] Yeah. - Or people sponsoring it, yeah. It's really surprising to me that people don't want to advertise on it. - I think map apps are very hard to like monetize. Google Maps also doesn't really make money. Sometimes you see these ads, but I don't think there's a lot of money there. You could put like a banner ad but it's kind of ugly, and the product is kind of like, it's kind of cool. So it's kinda fun to like subsidize it. And it's kinda a little bit part of Nomad List. I put it on Nomad List in the cities as well. But I also realized, you don't need to monetize everything. Some products are just cool and it's cool to have Hoodmaps exist. I want this to exist, right? - Yeah, there's a bunch of stuff you've created that I'm just glad exists in this world. That's true. And it's a whole nother puzzle. And I'm surprised to figure out how to make money off of it. I'm surprised maps don't make money, but you're right, it's hard. It's hard to make money. - Yeah. - 'Cause there's a lot of compute required to actually bring it to life. - Also, where do you put the ad, right? If you have a website, you can put an ad box or you can do a product placement or something. But you're talking about a map app that where 90% of the interface is a map. So what are you gonna do? It's hard to figure out where is this? - Yeah, and people don't wanna pay for it. - No, exactly, because if you make people pay for it, you lose 99% of the user base and you lose the crowdsource data. So it's not fun anymore. It stops being accurate, right? They pay for it by crowdsourcing the data, but then, yeah, it's fine. It doesn't make money, but it's cool. - But that said, Nomad List makes money. - Yeah. - So what was the story behind Nomad List? So Nomad List started because I was in Chiang Mai in Thailand, which is now like the second city here. And I was working on my laptop. I met like other nomads there, and I was like, okay, this seems like a cool thing to do, like working on your laptop in a different country, kinda travel around. But back then the internet everywhere was very slow. So the internet was fast in, for example, Holland or United States, but in a lot of parts in South America or Asia was very slow, like 0.5 megabits. So you couldn't watch a YouTube video. Thailand weirdly had like quite fast internet. But I wanted to find like other cities where I could go to like work on my laptop, whatever, and travel. But we needed like fast internet. So I was like, let's crowdsource this information with a spreadsheet. And I also needed to know the cost of living, 'cause I didn't have a lot of money. I had $500 a month. So I had to find a place where the rent was $200 per month or something where I had some money that I could actually rent something and there was Nomad List. And it still runs. I think it's now almost 10 years. - So it's just to describe how it works. - [Pieter] Yeah. - I'm looking at Chiang Mai here. There's a total score, rank number two. - Yeah, that's a number score. - 4.82 like by members. But it's looking at the internet. In this case, it's fast. - Yeah. - Fun, temperature, humidity, air quality, safety, food safety, crime, racism or lack of crime, lack of racism, educational level, power grid, vulnerability, to climate change, income level. - It's a little much. - English. It's awesome. It's awesome. Walkability. - Keep getting stuff. - Because for certain groups of people, certain things really matter. And this is really cool. - Yeah. - Happiness. I'd love to ask you about that. Nightlife, free Wi-Fi, AC, female friendly, freedom of speech. - Yeah, not so good in Thailand. - Values derived from national statistics. (laughs) I like how that one. - I need to do that because the data sets are usually national. They're not on city level, right? - Yes. - So I dunno about the freedom of speech between Bangkok or Chiang Mai. I know them in Thailand. - I mean this is really fascinating. So this is for city? - Yeah. - Is basically rating all the different things that matter to you and internet. And this is all crowdsourced. - Well, so started crowdsourced, but then I realized that you can download more accurate data sets from like public source, like World Bank. They have a lot of public data sets, United Nations, and you can download a lot of data there, which you can freely use. I started getting frauds crowdsource data where, for example, people from India, they really love India, and they would submit the best scores for everything in India. And not just like one person, but like a lot of people, they would love to pump India. And I'm like, I love India too, but that's not valid data. So you started getting discrepancies in the data between where people where from and stuff. So I started switching to data sets, and now it's mostly data sets, but one thing that's still crowdsourced is, so people add where they are, they add their travels to their profile and use that data to see which places are upcoming and which places are popular now. So about half the ranking you see here is based on actual digital nomads who are there. You can click on the city, you can click on people, and you can see the people, the users that are actually there. And it's like 30,000, 45,000 members. So these people are in Austin now. - 1,800 remote workers in Austin now. - Yeah. - Of which 8+ members checked in. Members who will be here soon and go. - Yeah, so we have meetups. - It's amazing. - So people organize their own meetups and we have about, I think like 30 per month. So it's like one meetup a day. And I don't do anything. They organize themselves. It's a whole black box. It just runs and I don't do a lot on it. It pulls data from everywhere and it just works. - Cons of Austin. It's too expensive, very sweaty, and humid now. Difficult to make friends. - Difficult to make friends. Interesting, right? I didn't know that. - Difficult to make friends- - In Austin. - But its all crowdsource, but mostly it's pros. - Yeah, Austin's very- - Pretty safe, fast internet. - I understand why it says not safe for women to check the dataset. It feels safe. The problem with a lot of places like United States is that it depends per area, right? - Yeah. - So if you get like city level data or nation level data, it's like Brazil is the worst because the range in like safe and wealthy and not safe is like huge. So you can't say many things about Brazil. - So once they actually show up to the city, how do you figure out what area? Like where to get fast Internet. For example, for me, it's consistently a struggle to figure out like- - Still. - Hotels with fast Wi-Fi, for example, like a place. Okay, okay, I show up to a city. There's a lot of fascinating puzzles, and I haven't figured out a way to actually solve this puzzle. When I show up to a city, figuring out where I can get fast internet connection and for podcasting purposes where I can find a place with a table that's quiet. - Right, yeah, yeah. - That's not easy. - Construction sounds. - All kinds of sounds. You get to learn about all the sources of sounds in the world, and also the quality of the room because the emptier the room and if it's just walls without any curtains or any of this kind of stuff, then there's echoes in the room anyway. But you figure out that a lot of hotels don't have tables. They don't have like normal. - They have this weird desk, right? - Yeah, they have- - But it's not a center table. - Yep, and if you want get a nicer hotel where it is more spacious and so on. They usually have these like boutique, fancy looking, modernist- - Annoying tables. - Tables, that don't- - Yeah, it's too designy. - It's too designy. - Yeah. - They're not really real tables. - What if you get Ikea? - Buy Ikea? - Yeah, before you arrive you order an Ikea. - Yeah. - Nomads do this. They get desks. - I feel like you should be able to show up to a place and have the desk. Unless you stay in there for a long time. Just the entire assembly, all that. Airbnb is so unreliable. The range in quality that you get- - Yeah. - Is huge. Hotels have a lot of problems, pros and cons. Hotels have the problem that the pictures, somehow never have good representative pictures of what's actually going to be in the room. - And that's the problem. Fake photos, man. - If I could have the kind of data you have on Nomad List for hotels. - Yeah, yeah, man. - And I feel like you can make a lot of money on that too. - Yeah, the booking fees affiliate, right? I thought about this idea, 'cause we have the same problem. I go to hotels, and there's specific ones that are very good and I know now the chains and stuff, but even if you go to some chains are very bad in a specific city and very good in other cities. - And each individual hotel has a lot of kinds of rooms. - Yeah. - Some are more expensive, some are cheaper, and so on. But you can get the details of what's in the room. What's the actual layout of the room, what is the view of the room. - You scan it. - I feel like as a hotel you can win a lot. So first, you create a service that allows you to have high resolution data about a hotel, then one hotel signs up for that. I would 100% use that website to look for a hotel instead of the crappy alternatives that don't give any information. And I feel like there'll be this pressure for all the hotels to join that site and you could make a ton of money, 'cause hotels make a lot of money. - I think it's true. But the problem is with these hotels, like it's same with airline industry. Why does every airline website suck when you try book a flights? - Yeah. - It's very strange. Why does it have to suck? Obviously, there's competition here. Why doesn't the best website win? - What's the explanation of that? - Man, I thought about this for years. So I think it's like I have to book the flight anyway. I know there's a route that they take and I need to book, for example, Qatar Airlines, and I need to get through this process. And with a hotel similar, you need a hotel anyway. So do you have time to like figure out the best one? Not really. You kind of just need to get the place booked and you need to get the flight and you'll go through the pain of this process. And that's why this process always sucks so much for hotels and airline websites and stuff. Because they don't have an incentive to improve it, because generally only for a super upper segment of the market, I think super high luxury, it affects the actual booking, right? - I don't know. I think that's an interesting theory. I think that must be a different theory. My theory would be that great engineers, great software engineers are not allowed to make changes. - [Pieter] Yeah. - Basically, there's some kind of bureaucracy, there's way too many managers. There's a lot of bureaucracy. And great engineers show up, they try to work there and they're not allowed to really make any contributions and then they leave. And so you have a lot of mediocre software engineers, they're not really interested in improving any other thing. - [Pieter] Yeah. - And literally, they would like to improve the stuff, but the bureaucracy of the place, plus all the bosses, all the high up people are not technical people probably. - [Pieter] Yeah. - They don't know much about web dev. They don't know much about programming. So they just don't give any respect. - Yeah. - You have to give the freedom and the respect to great engineers as they try to do great things. That feels like an explanation. If you were a great programmer, would you wanna work at America Airlines or? - No, no. - I'm torn on that 'cause I actually as somebody who loves program, would love to work at America Airlines so I can make the thing better. - Yeah, I would work there just to fix it for myself. - Yeah, for yourself. And then you just know how much suffering you're alleviated. - [Pieter] Yeah, yeah, for the world, for society. - Just imagine all the thousands, maybe millions of people that go to that website. - Yeah. - And have to click like a million times. It often doesn't work. It's clunky, all that kind of stuff. You're making their life just so much better. - Much better, yeah. - Yeah. There must be an explanation that has to do with managers and bureaucracies. - I think it's money. Do you know booking.com? - Sure. - So it's a booking. It's the biggest booking website in the world. - Yeah. - It's Dutch actually. And they have teams because my friend worked there. They have teams for a specific part of the website, like a 10 by 10 pixels area where they run tests on this. So they run tests like, and they're famous for this stuff. Oh, there's only one room left, right? Which is red letters. One room left book now. And they got a fine from the European Union about this, kind of interesting. So they have all these teams and they run the test for 24 hours. They go to sleep. They wake up next day they come to the office, and they see, okay, this performed better. This website has become a monster, but it's the most revenue generating hotel booking website in the world. It's number one. So that shows that it's not about user experience, it's about like, I don't know about making more money, not every company. It's a public company, if they're optimizing for money. - But you can optimize for money by disrupting, like making it way better. - Yeah, but it's always start, they start with disrupting. Booking all started as a startup 1997. And then they become like the old shit again. Uber now starts to become a taxi again, right? It was very good in the beginning. Now it's kind of like taxis now in many places are better. They're nicer than Ubers, right? So it's like this circle. - I think some of it is also just, it's hard to have ultra competent engineers. - Yeah. - Stripe seems like a trivial thing, but it's hard to pull off. - Yeah. - Why was it so hard for Amazon to have buy with one click? Which I think is a genius idea. - Yeah. - Make buying easier. Make it as frictionless as possible. Just click a button once thing you bought the thing. - [Pieter] Yeah. - As opposed to most of the web was a lot of clicking, and it often doesn't work. - Yeah. - Like with the Airlines. - Remember the forms would delete, you could click Next, Submit, and 404 or something where your internet would go down. - Yeah. - Your modem. - Yeah. - That, man. - And I would have an existential crisis. The frustration would take over my whole body. - [Pieter] Yes. - And I would just wanted to quit life for a brief moment there. - Yeah. - Yeah. - I'm so happy to form stays in Google Chrome now when something goes wrong. So Google, somebody at Google improve society with that, right? - Yeah, and one of the challenges of Google is to have the freedom to do that. - They don't anymore. - There's a bunch of bureaucracy, yeah. - Yeah, at Google. - There's so many brilliant, brilliant people there. - Yeah. - But it just moves slowly. - Yeah. - And I wonder why that is, and maybe that's the natural way of a company, but you have people like Elon who rolls in and just fires most of the folks and always operate, like push the company to operate as a startup, even what's already big. - Yeah, I mean, Apple does this. I like I started in business school, Apple does competing product teams that operate as startups. So three to five people, they make something, they have multiple teams do make the same thing. The best team wins. I think you need to emulate like a free market inside a company to make it entrepreneurial. - Yeah. - And you need entrepreneurial mentality in a company to come up with new ideas and do it better. - So one of the things you do really, really well is learn. And you think like you're trying to... You have an idea, you try to build it, and then you learn everything you need to in order to build it. You have your current skills, but you need learn just the minimal amount of stuff. So you're a good person to ask like, how do you learn? How do you learn quickly and effectively and just the stuff you need? Just by way of example, you did a 30 days learning session on 3D. - [Pieter] Yeah. - Where you documented yourself, giving yourself only 30 days to learn everything you can about 3D. - Yeah, I tried to learn virtuality 'cause I was like... This was same as AI, it came up suddenly like 2016, 2017, with I think HTC VIVE, this big VR glasses before Apple Vision Pro. I was like, oh, this is gonna be big, so I need to learn this. I know nothing about 3D. I installed like, I think Unity, and Blender and stuff. And I started learning all this stuff because I thought this was like a new nascent technology that was gonna be big. And if I had the skills for it, I could use this to build stuff. And so I think with learning for me, I think learning is so funny 'cause people always ask me, "How do you learn to code?" Should I learn to code?" And I'm like, "I don't know." Every day I'm learning. It's kind of cliche, but every day I'm learning new stuff. So every day I'm searching on Google or asking out ChatGPT, how to do this thing, how to do this thing. Every day, I'm getting better at my skill. So you never stop learning. So the whole concept of like how do you learn? Well, you never ends. So where do you want to be? Do you wanna know a little bit? Or do you wanna know a lot? Do you wanna do it for your whole life? So I think taking action is the best step to learn. So making things like, you know nothing, just start making things. Okay, so like how to make a website? Search how to make a website. Or nowadays you ask ChatGPT, how do I make a website? Where do I start? It generates codes for you, right? Copy the code, put it in a file, save it, open it in Google Chrome or whatever. You have a website and then you start tweaking with it, and you start, okay, how do I add a button? How do I add AI features, right, nowadays. So it's like by taking action, you can learn stuff much faster than I'm reading books, or tutorials. - Actually, I'm curious, let me ask perplexity. How do I make a website? I'm just curious what it would say. I hope it goes with like really basic vanilla solutions. Define your website's purpose. Choose a domain name. Select a web hosting provider. Choose a website or builder or CMS, website build a platform Wix. - Tells that Wix or Squarespace is what I said. - Yeah. - The landing page. - How do I say if I wanna program it myself? Design your website, create essential pages. - Yeah, even tells you to launch it, right? Start promoting it. - Launch your website. - Cool. - Well, I mean you could do that. - Yeah, but this is literally it. - [Lex] If you wanna make a website. - This is the basic like Google Analytics, - Well, you can't make Nomad List with this way. - You can. - With Wix. - No, you can get pretty far, I think. - You get pretty far. - These website builders are pretty advanced. All you need is a grid of images, right? - Yeah. - That are clickable. That open like another page. - Yeah. - You can get quite far. - How do I learn to program? Choose a programming language to start with. - Yeah, FreeCodeCamp is good. - Work through resources systematically, practice coding regularly for 30, 60 minutes a day. Consistency is key. Join programming communities like Reddit's. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it is pretty good. - Yeah. - It's pretty good. - So I think it's a very good starting ground, 'cause imagine you know nothing and you wanna make a website, you wanna make a startup. This is like, that's why, man, the power of AI for education is gonna be insane. People anywhere can ask this question and start building stuff. - Yeah, it clarifies it for sure, and just start building. Like keep- - Yeah. - Build, build. Like actually apply the thing, whether it's AI, or any of the programming for web development. - Yeah. - Just have a project in mind, which I love the idea of like 12 startups in 12 months or like build a project almost every day. - Yeah. - Just build a thing. - Yeah. - And get it to work, and finish it every single day. That's a cool experiment. - I think that was the inspiration. There was a girl who did 160 websites and 160 days or something. Literally mini websites. - Yeah. - And she learned to code that way. So I think it's good to set yourself challenges. You can go to some coding bootcamp, but I don't think they actually work. I think it's better to do, for me, how to deduct like self-learning and setting yourself like challenges and just getting in, but you need discipline. You need to discipline to keep doing it. And coding is very, it's a steep learning curve to get in. It's very annoying. Working with computers is very annoying. So it can be hard for people to keep doing it. - Yeah, that thing of just keep doing it and don't quit, that urgency that's required to finish a thing. That's why it's really powerful when you documented this, the creation of Hoodmaps or like a working prototype that there is just a constant frustration I guess. It's like oh, okay, how do I do this? And then you look it up, and you're like, okay, you have to interpret the different options you have. - Yeah, man. - And then just try it, and then there's a dopamine rush of like, "Ooh, it works cool." - Man, it's amazing. I live streamed it. It's on YouTube and stuff. People can watch it, and it's amazing when things work. Look, it's just like a main that you, I look very not... I don't look far ahead. So I only look, okay, what's the next problem to solve, and then the next problem? And at the end, you have a whole app or website or thing. But I think most people look way too far ahead. It's like this poster again. You don't know hard it's gonna be, so you should only look like for the next thing, the next little challenge, the next step. And then see where you end up. - And as assume it's gonna be easy. (laughs) - Yeah, exactly. Be naive about it. Because you're gonna have very difficult problems. A lot of the big problems won't be even tech, will be like public, right? Maybe people don't like your website. You will get canceled for a website, for example. A lot of things can happen. - What's it like building in public, like you do? Openly, where you're just iterating quickly and you getting people feedback. So there's the power of the crowdsourcing, but there's also the negative aspects of people being able to criticize. - So man, I think haters are actually good, 'cause I think a lot of haters have good points. - Yeah. - And it takes like stepping away from the emotion of like, ah, your website sucks because blah, blah, blah. And you're like, okay, just remove this. Your website sucks 'cause it's personal. What did he say? Why did he didn't not like it? And you figure out, okay, he didn't like it 'cause the signup was difficult or something, or it wasn't the data. They say, no, this data is not accurate or something, right? Okay, I need to improve the quality of data. This hater has a point, because it's dumb to completely ignore your haters. And also, man, I think I've been there when I was like 10 years old or something. You're on the internet just shouting crazy stuff that's like most of Twitter, or the half Twitter. So you have to take it with grain of salt. Yeah, man, you need to grow a very thick skin on Twitter, on X. But I'm mute a lot of people. I found out I muted already 15,000 people recently, I checked. So in 10 years, I muted 15,000 people. So that's like- - That's one by one manual. - Yeah. - Oh, wow. - So 1,500 people per year. And I don't like to block, 'cause then they get angry, they make a screenshot and they say, ah, ah, you block me. So I just mute and it disappear and it's amazing. - So you mentioned Reddit. So Hoodmaps, did that make it to the front page of Reddit? - Yeah, yeah it did, yeah, yeah, yeah it did. It was amazing. And my server almost went down, and I was checking like Google Analytics was like 5,000 people on the website or something crazy. And it was at night and it was amazing. Man, I think nowadays, honestly, TikTok, YouTube reels, Instagram reels. A lot of apps get very big from people making TikTok videos about it. So let's say you make your own app, you can make a video for yourself. Oh, I made this app. This is how it works, blah, blah, blah. And this is why I made it, for example. And this is why you should use it. And if it's a good video, we'll take off, and you will get, man, I got like $20,000 extra per month or something from a TikTok from one TikTok video. It made a Photo AI. - By you or somebody else? - By some random guy. So there's all these AI influencers that they write about. They show AI apps and then they ask money later, like when a video goes viral. I can do it again, and send me $4,000 or something. I'm like, okay, I did that, for example. But it works. TikTok is a very big platform for user acquisition, yeah. And Organic, like the best user acquisition I think is Organic. You don't need to buy ads. You probably don't have money when you start to buy ads. So use Organic or write a banger, tweet, right? That's can make an app take off as well. - Well, I mean yeah, fundamentally create cool stuff and have just a little bit of a following enough to like for the cool thing to be noticed. And then it becomes viral if it's cool enough. - Yeah, and you don't need a lot of followers anymore on X and a lot of platforms 'cause TikTok X, I think in reels also, they have the same algorithm now. It's not about followers anymore, it's about they test your content on a small subset, like 300 people. If they like it, it will gets tested to a thousand people and on and on. So if the thing is good, it will rise anyway. It doesn't matter if you have half a million followers or a thousand followers or hundred. - What's your philosophy of monetizing how to make money from the thing you build? - Yeah, so a lot of starters, they do like free users. So you could sign up and could use an app for free, which is... It never worked for me well, because I think free users generally don't convert. And I think if you have VC funding, it makes sense to get free users, because you can spend your funding on ads and you can get like millions of people come in predictably how much they convert and give them like a free trial, whatever, and then they sign up. But you need to have that flow worked out so well for you to make it work, that you need like... It's very difficult. I think it's best to start and just start asking people for money in the beginning. So show your app, what are you doing on your landing page? Make a demo or whatever video. And then if you wanna use it, pay me money, pay $10, $20, $40. I would ask more than $10 per month. Netflix, like $10 per month. But Netflix is a giant company, they can afford to make it so cheap, relatively cheap. If you're an individual, like an indie hacker, you are making your own app. You need to make like at least $30 or more on a user to make it worthy for you. You need to make money. - And it builds a community of people that actually really care about the product. - Also, yeah. Making a community, making a discord very normal now. Every AI app has a discord and you have the developers and the users together in a discord, and they talk about, they ask for features they build together. It is very normal now. And you need to imagine like if you're starting out, getting a thousand users is quite difficult, getting a thousand pages is quite difficult. And if you charge them like $30, you have 30K a month, and it's a lot of money. - That's enough to like- - Live a good life. - Yeah, live a pretty good life. I mean that could be a lot of costs associated with hosting. - Yeah, so that's another thing. I make sure my profit margin are very high. So I try to keep the cost very low. I don't hire people. I try to negotiate with AI vendors now, can you make it cheaper? I discovered this, you can just email companies and say, "Can you give me discount? It's too expensive." And they say, "Sure, 50%." I'm like, "Wow, very good." (Lex laughs) And I didn't know this, you can just ask. And especially in like now it's kind of recession, you can ask companies like, I need a discount or I kind of need to like, you don't need to be asshole about it. Say, "I kind of need a discount or I need to go maybe to another company, maybe discount here and there." And they say, "Sure." A lot of them will say yes. Like 25% discount, 50% discounts, 'cause you think the price on the website is the price of the API or something. It's not. - And also you're a public facing person. - Oh, that helps also. - And there's love and good vibes that you put out into the world. You're actually legitimately trying to build cool stuff. So a lot of companies probably wanna associate with you because you're trying to do. - Yeah, it's like a secret hack, but I think even without- - Secret hack. Be a good person. - It depends how much discount they will give. They'll maybe give more, but you know that's why you should post on Twitter so you get discounts maybe. (Lex and Pieter laughs) - Yeah, yeah. And also when it's crowdsourced, I mean paying does prevent spam or help prevent spam. - Also, yeah. Yeah, it gives you high quality users. - High quality users. - Free users are sure, but they're horrible. It's just like millions of people, especially with AI startups, you get a lot of abuse. So you get millions of people from anywhere just abusing your app, just hacking it and whatever. - There's something on the internet. You mentioned like 4chan discovered Hoodmaps. - Yeah, but I love 4chan. I don't love 4chan, but you know what I mean, like they're so crazy, especially back then. It's kind of funny what they do. - I actually, what is it? This new documentary on Netflix "Antisocial Network" or something like that that was really- - Interesting. - Was fascinating. Just 4chan, the spirit of the thing, 4chan. - And people just understand 4chan. - It's so much about freedom and also like the humor involved and fucking with the system and fucking, man. - That's it. It's just anti-system for fun. - The dark aspect of it is you're having fun, you're doing anti-system stuff, but like the Nazis always show up and it somehow- - Really bad shit started happening. - It drifting somehow, yeah. - It like school shootings and stuff. So it's a very difficult topic, but I do know, especially early on, I think 2010, I would go to 4chan for fun, and they would post crazy offensive stuff. And this was just to scare off people. So we show to other people say, "Hey, do you know this internet website 4chan? Just check it out." - Yeah. (laughs) - And they'd be, "Dude, what the fuck is that?" I'm like, no, no, you don't understand. - Yeah. - That's to scare you away. But actually when you go through scroll, there's like deep conversations. - Yes. - And they would already be, this was like a normie filter, like to stop. - Yeah. - So kind of cool. But yeah- - It goes dark. - It goes dark, yeah. - And if you have those people show up, for the fun of it, do a bunch of racist things and all that kind of stuff you were saying. - Yeah, but everything is, I think it was never, man, I'm not at 4chan, but it was always about provoking. It's just provocateur. - But the provoking in the case of Hoodmaps or something like this can- - Oh, man. - Can damage a good thing like (laughs) a little poison in a town is always good. It's like the Tom Waits thing, but you don't want too much otherwise it destroys the town. It destroys the thing. - Yeah, they're kind like pen testers, like penetration testers, hackers. - Yeah. - They just test your app for you and then you add some stuff, like I add like a NSFW word list. They would say like bad words. So when they would write like a bad words, they would get forwarded to YouTube, which was like a video. It was like a very relaxing video that like kind of ASMR with like glowing jelly streaming like this to relax them, or cheese melting on the toast. - Cheese melting, nice. - And to chill them out. - Yeah, yeah. - I like it. - Yeah. - But actually a lot of stuff I didn't realize how much originated in 4chan in terms of memes. Rickroll, I didn't understand. I did not know that Rickroll originated 4chan. - Really? - There's so many memes, like most of the memes that you think- - The word roll I think comes from 4chan, like not the word roll, but in this case, in the meme use. - Yeah. - You would get like roll doubles, 'cause there was like post IDs on 4chan. So they were kinda like random. So if I get doubles, this happens or something. So you'd get like two, two. Anyway, it's like a betting market kind of on these doubles, on these post IDs, this so much funny stuff. - Yeah, I mean that's the internet, that's purist. But yeah, again, the dark stuff kind of seeps in. - [Pieter] Yeah. - It's nice to keep the dark stuff to some low amount. It's nice to have a bit of noise of the darkness, but not too much. - Yeah. - But again, you have to pay attention to that with, I mean I guess spam in general. You have to fight that with Nomad List. How do you fight spam? - Man, I use GPT-4 now. It's amazing. (laughs) So I have like user input have reviews, people can review cities. And I don't need to actually sign up. It's anonymous reviews. And they write whole books about cities and what's good and bad. So I run into GPT-4 now, and I ask like, "Is this a good review? Is this offensive? Is this race is this or some stuff?" And then send me message on Telegram when it rejects reviews and I check it, and man, it's so on point. It's so- - Automated. - Yes, and it's so accurate. It understands double meanings. I have GPT-4 running on the chat community. It's a chat community of 10,000 people, and they're chatting, and they start fighting with each other. And I used to have human moderators was very good, but they would start fighting the human moderator. This guy's biased or something. I have GPT-4. And it's really, really, really, really good. It understands humor. It understands like you could say something bad, but it's kinda a joke, and it's kind of not offensive so much, so it shouldn't be deleted, right? It understands that. - I would love to have a GPT-4 based filter of different kinds for like X. - Yeah, I thought this week like, I tweeted like a fact check. You can click Fact Check and then GPT-4. Look, GPT-4 is not always right about stuff, right? But it can give you a general fact check on a tweet. Usually, what I do now when I write something like difficult about economics or something about AI. I put in GPT-4 say, "Can you fact check it?" 'Cause I might have said something stupid. And the stupid stuff always gets taken out by the replies. Oh, you said this wrong. And then the whole tweet kind of doesn't make sense anymore. So I ask GPT-4 the fact check a lot of stuff. - So fact check is a tough one. - Yeah. - But it would be interesting to sort of rate a thing based on how well-thought out it is and how well-argued it is. - Yeah. - That seems more doable. That seems like more doable. It seems like a GPT thing because that that's less about the truth and it's more about the rigor of the thing. - Exactly, and you can ask that, you can ask in the prompt like, I don't know, for example, do you think... Create like a ranking score for X Twitter applies where I should dispose be, if we rank on like, I dunno, integrity, reality, like fundamental deepness or something, interestingness. And it will give you with a pretty good score probably. I mean Elon can do this with Grok, right? He can start using that to check replies, because the reply section is like chaos. - Yeah, and actually the ranking and the replies is not great. - Doesn't make any sense. - Doesn't make sense. - No. - And I would like to sort in different kinds of ways. - Yeah, and you get too many replies now, if you have a lot of followers. I get too many replies. I don't see everything and a lot of stuff I just miss and I wanna see the good stuff. - And also the notifications or whatever, is just complete chaos. - Yeah. - It'd be nice to be able to filter that in interesting ways, sorted in interesting ways. 'Cause I feel like I miss a lot and what's surfaced for me is just a random comment by a person with no followers. - Yeah, yeah. - That's positive or negative. It's like, okay, - If it's a very good comment, it should happen, but it should probably look a little bit more, do these people have followers, 'cause they're probably more engaged in the platform, right? - Oh, no. I don't even care about how many followers. If you're ranking by the quality of the comment, great. - Yeah. - But not just randomly, like chronological, just a sea of comments. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, it does make sense. - Yeah. - Yeah. X could be very proof of that, I think. - One thing you espouse a lot, which I love is the automation step. So once you have a thing... Once you have an idea and you build it, and it actually starts making money. And it's making people happy, there's a community of people using it. You want to take the automation step of automating the things you have to do as little work as possible for it to keep running indefinitely. - Yeah. - Can you explain your philosophy there? What do you mean by automate? - Yeah, so the general theory of starters would be that when it starts, you start making money, you start hiring people to do stuff, right? Do stuff that you, like marketing, for example. Do stuff that you would do in the beginning yourself, and whatever community management and organizing meetups for Nomad List, for example, that would be a job, for example. And I felt like I don't have the money for that and I don't really wanna run a big company with a lot of people, 'cause there's a lot of work managing these people. So I've always tried to automate these things as much as possible. And this can literally be like for Nomad List, it's literally like a... It's not a different other sources. It was like a webpage where you can organize your own meetup, set a schedule, a date, whatever. You could see how many nomads will be there at that date. So there will be actually enough nomads to meet up, right? And then when it's done, it sends a tweet out on the Nomad List account. There's a meetup here. It sends a direct message to everybody in the city who are there, who are gonna be there. And then people show up on a bar and there's a meetup and that's fully automated. And for me, it's so obvious to make this automatic, why would you have somebody organize this? It makes more sense to automate it. And with most of my things, like I figure out how to do it with codes. And I think especially now with AI, you can automate so much more stuff than before. 'Cause AI understands things so well. Like before I would use if statements, right? Now you ask GPT, you put something on GPT-4, and in the API and it sends back like, this is good, this is bad. - Yeah, so you basically can now even automate sort of subjective type of things. This is the difference now. - Yeah. - And that's very recent, right? - But it's still difficult to, I mean that's step of automation is difficult to figure out how to... Is you're basically delegating everything to code. - Yeah. - And it's not trivial to take that step for a lot of people. So when you say automate, are you talking about like CronJob? - Yes, man, a lot of CronJob. - A lot of CronJobs. - Yeah. - I literally, I log into the server and I do like sudo crontab-e, and then I go into editor and I write like hourly and then I write PHP, dothisthing.php, and that's a script. And that script does a thing and it does it then hourly. That's it. And that's how all my websites work. - Do you have a thing where it like emails you or something like this? Or emails somebody managing the thing, if something goes wrong? - I have these webpage that make, they're called like healthchecks. It's like healthcheck.php, and then it has emojis, it has a green check mark if it's good, and a read one if it's bad. And then it does like database cures, for example. Like what's the internet speed in, for example, Amsterdam. Okay, it's a number. It's like 27 point megabits. So it's accurate number. Okay, check, good. And it goes to the next, and it goes on all the data points. Did people sign up in it last 24 hours? It's important 'cause maybe the sign up broke. Okay, check, somebody sign up. Then I have uptimerobot.com, which is like for Uptime, but it can also check keywords. It checks for an emoji, which is like the red X, which is if something is bad. And so it opens that health check page every minute to check if something's bad. Then if it's bad, it sends a message to me on Telegram saying, "Hey, what's up?" Or it doesn't say, "Hey, what's up?" It sends me like alert. (Lex laughs) - Hey, hey, sweetie. - This thing is down and then I check. So within a minute of something breaking, I know it and then I can open my laptop and fix it. - Yeah. - But the good thing is like the last few years, things don't break anymore. And definitely 10 years ago, when I started, everything was breaking all the time. And now it's like almost, last week was like a 100.000% Uptime. And these health checks are part of the Uptime percentage. So it's like everything works. - You're actually making me realize I should have a page for myself. Like one page that has all the healthchecks, just so I can go to it and see all the green check marks. - It feels good to look at, you know. - It just be like, okay. - Yeah. - All right, we're okay. Everything's okay. - Yeah. - And like you can see like, when was the last time something wasn't okay, and it'll say like never. - Yeah. - Or meaning like you've checked since you've last cared to check, it's all been okay. - For sure. It used to send me the good healthchecks. - Yeah. - It all works, it all works. - But it's been- - It all works. - [Lex] So often. (laughs) - And I'm like, this feels so good. But then I'm like, okay, obviously, it's not gonna, we need to hide the good ones and show only the bad ones, and now that's the case. - I need to integrate everything into one place. I automate like everything. - Yeah, yeah. - Also just a large set of CronJob. A lot of the publication of this podcast is done all, everything's just on automatically, it's all clipped up. All this kind of stuff. - Wow, yeah. - But it would be nice to automate even more. - Yeah. - Like translation, all this kind of stuff would be nice to automate. - Yeah, every JavaScript, every PHP error gets sent to my Telegram as well. So every user, whatever user it is, doesn't have to be page user. If they run into a error, the JavaScript sends the JavaScript error to the server and then it sends to my Telegram, from all my websites. - So you get like a message. - So I get like a uncut, variable error, whatever, blah, blah, blah. And then I'm like, "Okay, interesting." And then I go check it out. And that's like a way to get to zero errors, 'cause you get flooded with errors in the beginning, and now it's like nothing almost. - So that's really cool. That's really cool. - But this is the same stuff people, they pay like very big SaaS companies. New Relic for right? To manage this stuff. So you can do that too. You can use off the shelf. I like to build myself. It's easier. - Yeah, it's nice. It's nice to do that kind of automation. I'm starting to think of like, what are the things in my life I'm doing myself that could be automated in addition. - You can ask GPT, give your daily your day and then ask you what parts you to automate. - Well, one of the things I would love to automate more is my consumption and social media. - [Pieter] Yeah. - Both the output and the input. - Man, I think there's some startups that do that. They summarize the cool shit happening on Twitter, with AI, I think the guy called SWYX or something, he does like a newsletter that's completely AI generated. We have the cool new stuff in AI. - Yeah, I mean I would love to do that. But also like across Instagram, Facebook- - Yeah. - LinkedIn. - Yeah. - All this kind of stuff. Just like, okay, can you summarize the internet for me (Pieter chuckles) For today? - Summarize internet.com. - Yeah, dot com. - Yeah. - Because I feel like it pulls into way too much time, but also like, I don't like the effect it has some days on my psyche. - Because of like haters or just general content and politics? - Just general. No, no, just general. Like for example, TikTok is a good example of that for me. I sometimes just feel dumber after I use TikTok. I just feel like- - [Pieter] Yeah, I don't use it anymore. - Empty somehow and I'm like uninspired. - Yeah. - It's funny in the moment I'm like, ha-ha, look at that cat doing a funny thing. And then you're like, oh, look at that person dancing in a funny way to that music. And then you're like, 10 minutes later you're like, I feel way dumber and I don't really wanna do much. - Yeah. - For the rest of the day. - My girlfriend said, she saw me like watching some dumb video. She's like, "Dude, your face looks so dumb as well." (Lex laughs) Your whole face starts going like, oh, interesting. - I mean with social media, with X sometimes for me too, I think I'm probably naturally gravitating towards the drama. - Yeah, hard wheel. - Yeah, and so with following AI people, especially AI people that only post technical content and it's been really good, 'cause then I just look at them, and then I go on down rabbit holes of like learning new papers that have been published or- - Yeah. - Git repos, or just any kind of cool demonstration of stuff and the kind of things that they retweet. And that's the rabbit hole I go and I'm learning and I'm inspired, all that kind of stuff. But it's been tough. It's been tough to control that. - It's difficult. You need to like manage your platforms. I have a mute board list as well, so I mute like politics stuff, 'cause I don't really want it on my feed. And I think I've muted so much that now my feed is good. I see interesting stuff, (Lex laughs) but the fact that you need to modify, you need to like mod your app, your social media platform- - Yeah. - Just to function and not be toxic for you, for your mental health, right? That's like a problem. It should be doing that for you. - It's some level of automation that would be interesting. I wish I could access X and Instagram through API easier. - You need to spend $42,000 a month, which my friends do. Yeah, you can do that. - But still, even if you do that, that you're not getting, I mean there's limitations that don't make it easy to do like- - Yeah. - Automate. The thing that they're trying to limit, like abuse or for you to steal all the data from the app to then train an LLM, or something like this. - Yeah. - But if I just wanna figure out ways to automate my interaction with the X system, or with Instagram, they don't make that easy. But I would love to sort of automate that and explore different ways to how to leverage LLMs to control the content I consume, and maybe publish that and maybe they themselves can see how that could be used to improve their system. - Yeah. - But there's not enough access. - Yes, if you could screen cap your phone, right? It could be an app that watches your screen with you. - You could, yeah. - But I don't even know like what it would do. Maybe it's can hide stuff before you see it. Scroll down. - I have that, I have Chrome extensions. I write a lot of Chrome extensions that hide parts of different pages and so on. - Yeah. - For example, on my main computer, I hide all views and likes and all that on YouTube content that I create. So that I don't- - Smart, doesn't affect you. - It doesn't, yeah. So you don't pay attention to it. - Yeah. - I also hide parts there. I have a mode for X where I hide most of everything. So there's no, it's same with YouTube. - I have the same, I have this extension. - Well, I wrote my own 'cause it's easier. - Yeah. - 'Cause it keeps changing. It's not easy to keep it dynamically changing, but they're really good at like getting you to be distracted and like starting to- - Related accounts, related post. - Related stuff. - I'm like, I don't want related. - And like 10 minutes later you're like, or something that's trending. I have a weird amount of friends addicted to YouTube, and I'm not addicted. I think 'cause my attention span is too short for YouTube. (Lex and Pieter laughs) But I have this extension to like YouTube Unhook, which it hides all the related stuff. I can just see the video and it's amazing. But sometimes I need to like, I need to search a video how to do something. And then I go to YouTube and then I had these YouTube shorts. These YouTube shorts are like, they're algorithmically designed to just make you tap them. And I tap and I then I'm like five minutes later, with this face, and you're just stuck. And it's like, what happened? I was gonna open, I was gonna play like the coffee mix, the music mix for drinking coffee together in the morning, like jazz, I didn't wanna go to shorts. So it's very difficult. - I love how we're actually highlighting all kinds of interesting problems that all could be solved at a startup. Okay, so what about the exit? When and how to exit? - Man, you shouldn't ask me 'cause I never sold my company, and I've- - So you've never... All the successful stuff you've done, you've never sold it. - Yeah, it's kind of sad, right? So I've been in a lot of acquisition like deals and stuff, and I learned a lot about finance people as well there, like manipulation and due diligence and then changing the valuation. People change the valuation after. A lot of people string you on to acquire you and then it takes six months. It's a classic. It takes six to 12 months. They wanna see everything. They wanna see your Stripe and your code and whatever. And then in the end, they'll change the price to lower, 'cause you're already so invested. So it's a negotiation tactic, right? I'm like, no, then I don't want to sell, right? And the problem with my companies is like, they make 90% profit margin. So the multiple, companies get sold with multiples, kind of multiples of profit or revenue. And often the multiple is like three times, three times or four times or five times revenue or profit. So in my case, they're all automated. So I might as as well wait three years and I get the same money as when I sell and then I can still sell the same company. You know what I mean? I can still sell for three, five times. So financially, it doesn't really make sense to sell. - Yeah. - Unless the price high enough. If the price gets to six or seven or eight, I don't wanna wait six years for the money. But if you give me three, like three years is nothing. I can wait. - So that means they're really valuable stuff about the companies you created is not just the interface and the crowdsource content, but the people themselves, like the user base. - Yeah. So Nomad List, it's a community, yeah. - So I could see that being extremely valuable. - Yeah. - I'm surprised that has not. - But Nomad List, it's like my baby. It's like my first project I took off, and I don't really know if I wanna sell it. It's like something you- - Yeah. - Would be nice when you're old to just still work on this. It has like a mission, which is like people should travel anywhere and they can work from anywhere and they can meet different cultures. And that's a good way to make the world get better. If you go to China and live in China, you'll learn that they're nice people. And a lot of stuff you hear about China's propaganda, a lot of stuff is true as well. But it's more, you know, you learn a lot from traveling. And I think that's why it's a cool product to not sell. AI products, I have less emotional feeling with AI products like photo AI, which I could sell, yeah. - Yeah, the thing you also mentioned is you have to price in the fact that you're going to miss. - Yeah. - The company you created. - And the meaning it gives you, right? There's a very famous depression after start finding a solar company. They're like, this was me. Like who am I? And they immediately start building another one. (Lex laughs) They never can stop. So I think it's good to keep working until you die. Just keep working on cool stuff and you shouldn't retire. I think retirement's bad probably. - So you usually build this stuff solo and mostly work solo. What's the thinking behind that? - I think I'm not so good working with other people. Not like I'm crazy, but I don't trust other people. - To clarify, you don't trust other people to do a great job. - Yeah, and I don't wanna have this consensus meeting where we all like, you have a meeting of three people and then you kind of get this compromise results, which is very European. In Holland, we call pull them whatever. You put people the room and you only let 'em out when they agree on the compromise, right? In politics. I think it breeds like averageness, you get an average idea, average company, average culture, you need to have a leader or you need to be solo and just do it, do it yourself, I think. And I trust some people, now with my best friend Andre, I'm making a new AI startup. But it's because we know each other very long and he's one of the few people I would build something with but almost never, yeah. - So what does it take to be successful when you have more than one? How do you build together with Andre? How do you build together with other people? - So he codes, I should post on Twitter. Literally, I promoted on Twitter. We set product strategy. I said, this should be better, this should be better. But I think you need to have one person coding it. He codes in Ruby so was like cannot do Ruby, I'm in PHP. - So have you ever coded with another person for prolonged periods of time? - Never in my life. (Lex laughs) - What do you think is behind that? - I know it was always just me sitting on my laptop, like coding. - No, like you've never had another developer who like rolls in and like? - I've had once with Photo AI, there's an AI developer, Philip, I hired him to do the... 'Cause I can't write Python. - Yeah. - And AI stuff is Python. And I needed to get models to work and replicate and stuff. And I needed to improve Photo AI. And he helped me a lot for 10 months he worked, and man, I was trying Python working with NumPy, and package manager and it was too difficult for me to figure this shit out. And I didn't have time. I think 10 years ago I would've time to sit, go do all-nighters to figure this stuff out with Python. I don't have the... It's not my thing, - But it's not your thing. It's another programming language, I get it. AI, new thing, got it. But you never had a developer roll in, look at your PHP, jQuery code and yes, like in conversation or improv- - Yeah. - They talk about yes, and, like basically, alright. - I had for one week. - Understand. - And that ended. - What happened? - Because he wanted to rewrite everything in the- - No, that's the wrong guy. - I know. - He wanted to rewrite and what? - He wanted to rewrite, he said this jQuery, we cannot do this. I'm like, okay. He's we need to rewrite a thing in Vue, vue.js I'm like, "Are you sure? Can we just like, you know, keep jQuery?" He's like, "No, man." And we need to change a lot of stuff. And I'm like, "Okay." And I was kinda feeling it like this, you know, we're gonna clean up shit. But then after week, this is gonna take way too much time. - I think I like working with people where when I approach them, I pretend in my head that they're the smartest person who has ever existed. - Wow. - So I look at their code or I look at the stuff they've created and try to see the genius of their way. You really have to understand people, like really notice them. And then from that place have a conversation about what is the better approach. - Yeah, but those are the top tier developers. - [Lex] Yeah. - Those are the ones that are tech ambiguous. So they can work with, they can learn any tech stack and they can- - Yeah. - And that's like really few, it's like- - Really? - Top 5%. - Damn. - Because if you try higher devs, no offense to devs, but most devs are not. Man, most people in general jobs are not so good at the job, even doctors and stuff. - That's too sad. - When you realize this, people are very average at the job. - Yeah. - Especially with dev with coding, I think. So sorry for- - I think that's a really important skill for a developer to roll in and understand the musicality, the style. - That's it, man. Empathy, it's like code empathy, right? - It's code empathy. - Yeah, it's new word, but that's it. You need to understand, go over the code, get a holistic view of it and man, you can suggest we change stuff, for sure. And look, jQuery is crazy. It's crazy, I'm using jQuery. We can change that. - It's not crazy at all. jQuery is also beautiful- - Yeah. - And powerful, and PHP is beautiful and powerful. Especially as you said recently, as the versions evolved, it's much more serious programming language now. It's super fast. - For sure. - Like PHP is really fast now. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - It's crazy JavaScripts- - Much faster than Ruby, yeah. - Really fast now. - Yeah. - So if speed is something you care about, it's super fast. - Yeah. - And there's gigantic communities of people- - [Pieter] Yeah. - Using those program languages, and there's frameworks if you like the framework. So whatever, it doesn't really matter what you use, but also you, if I was like a developer working with you, like you are extremely successful. You've shipped a lot. - Yeah. - So like if I roll in, I'm gonna be like, I don't assume you know nothing. Assume Pieter is a genius, like the smartest developer ever. And like learn, learn from it. - Yeah. - And yes and. Notice parts in the code where like, okay, okay, okay. I got it. - Yeah. - Here's how he's thinking. And now if I want to add another, like a little feature, definitely needs to have emoji. (laughs) - Yeah, man. - In front of it. And then like just follow the same style and add it. - [Pieter] Yeah. - And my goal is to make you happy, to make you smile, to make you, ha-ha, fuck, I get it. And now you're going to start respecting me. - Yeah. - And like trusting me, and you start working together in this way. I don't know. I don't know how hard it's to find developers. - No, I think they exist. I think I need to hire more people. I need to try more people. - Try people, yeah. - But that costs a lot of my energy and time. - Yeah. - But it's 100% possible. - Yeah. - But do I want it? I don't know, things kind of run fine for now. (Lex laughs) And I mean like, okay. You could say like, okay, Nomad List looks kind of clunky. People say the design's gonna clunky. Okay, I'll improve the design. It's like next to my to-do list, for example. I'll get there eventually. - But it's true. I mean you're also extremely good at what you do. I'm just looking at the interfaces of Photo AI. You with jQuery, right? How amazing is jQuery? These cowboys are getting, these are... There's these cowboys. This is a lot, this is a lot. But I'm glad they're all wearing shirts. Anyway, the interface here is just really, really nice. I could tell you know what you're doing and with Nomad List extremely nice, the interface. - Thank you, man. - And that's all you. - [Pieter] Yeah, that's everything is me. - So all of this and every little feature. All of this. - People say it looks kind of ADHD or ADD, like it's so much because it has so many things and designs these days is minimalist. Right? - Right, right, I hear you. But this is a lot of information and it's useful information, and it's delivered in a clean way while still stylish and fun to look at. So like minimalist design is about when you want to convey no information whatsoever- - Yeah. - And look cool. - Yeah, it's very cool. It's pretentious, right? - Pretentious or not, the function is useless. This is about a lot of information delivered to you in a clean, and when it's clean you can't be too sexy. So it's sexy enough. - Yeah, this is I think how my brain looks. It's a lot of shit going on. It's like drawing bass music. It's like very (imitates bass music) - Yeah, but it's this still... The spacing of everything is nice. The fonts are really nice. Like very readable, very small. - Yeah, I like it, you know, but I made it so I don't trust my own judgment. - No, this is really nice. - Thank you, man. - Emojis are somehow, like this is a style, it's a thing. - I need to pick the emoji. It takes a while to pick them. - Something about the emoji is a really nice memorable, like placeholder for the idea. - Yeah. - If it was just text, it would actually be overwhelming if you was just text. The emoji really helps. That's a brilliant addition. Some people might look at it, why do you have emojis everywhere? It's actually really, for me, it's really- - People tell me to remove the emojis. - Yeah, well, people don't know what they're talking about. - Makes it immature. - I'm sure people will tell you a lot of things. This is really nice. And then using color is nice. Small font but not too small. And obviously, you have to show maps, which is really tricky. - Yeah. - Yeah. - This is nice. - No, this is really, really, really nice. I mean, okay, how this looks when you hover over it? - Yeah, it's easy as transitions. - No, I understand that. I'm sure there's like, how long does that take you to figure out how you want it to look? Do you ever go down a rabbit hole where you spent like two weeks? - No, it's all iterative. It's like 10 years of, you know, added C transition here or do this or. - Well, let's say like, see these are rounded now. - Yeah. - If you wanted to like round is probably the better way. But if you want it to be rectangular, like sharp corners, what would you do? You just? - So go to the index at CSS. - Yeah. - And I do Command + F. and I search border radius 12 px. - [Lex] Yeah. - And then I replace with border radius zero. And then I do Command + Enter- - Yeah. - And it's get deploys, it pushes to the git hub and then sends a WebBook and then deploys to my server, and it's live in five seconds. - Oh, you often deployed to production. You don't have like a testing ground? - No. (Lex laughs) So I'm like famous for this, 'cause I'm too lazy to set up a staging server on my laptop every time. So nowadays I just deploy to production. - [Lex] Yeah. - Man, I'm gonna be canceled for this. But it works very well for me, 'cause I have a lot of... I have PHP Lint and djLint so it tells me when there's error. So I don't deploy. - Yeah. - But literally, I have like 37,000 git commits in the last 12 months or something. So I make small fix and then Command + Enter, and sends to GitHub. GitHub sends a web to server, web server pulls it, deploys the production, and is there. - What's the latency of that from you pressing Command + Enter? - One second, can be one two seconds. - So you just make a change and then you- - That's right. - Getting really good at like not making mistakes basically. - Man, 100%, you're right. People are like, how can you do this? Well, you get good at not taking the server down. - Yeah. - 'Cause you need to code more carefully. Look, it's idiotic in any big company. But for me, it works 'cause it makes me so fast. Somebody will report a bug on Twitter and I kind of did do a stopwatch. How fast can I fix this bug? And then two minutes later, for example, it's fixed. - [Lex] Yeah. - And it's fun 'cause it's annoying for me to work with companies where you report a bug and it takes like six months. - Yeah. - It's like horrible. And it makes people really happy when you can really quickly solve their problems. But it's crazy, I admit. - I don't think it's crazy. I mean, I'm sure there's a middle ground, but I think that whole thing where there's a phase of like testing and there's the staging, and there's a development and then there's like multiple tables and databases that you use for the stage. Like it's- - Filing. - It's a mess. - Yeah. - And there's different teams involved. It's not good. - I'm like a good funny extreme on the other side. - But just a little bit safer but not too much. It would be great. - Yeah, yeah. - And I'm sure that's actually like how X now, how they're doing rapid improvement. It's exactly. - No, they do because there's more bugs. - Yeah. - And people complain about like, oh look, he bought this Twitter. Now it's full of bugs. Dude, these shipping stuff- - Yeah. - Things are happening now and it's a dynamic app now. - Yeah, the bugs is actually a sign of a good thing happening. - Yes. - The bugs of the feature because it shows- - Yes. - That the team is actually building shit. - 100%, yeah. - Well, one of the problems is like I see with YouTube there's so much potential to build features, but I just see how long it takes. So I've gotten a chance to interact with many other teams. But one of the teams is MLA, multi-language audio. - Yeah. - I dunno if you know this, but in YouTube you can have audio tracks in different languages. - Yeah. - For over dubbing. And there's a team, and not many people are using it, but like every single feature, they have to meet and agree, and there's allocate resources. Engineers have to work on it. But I'm sure it's a pain in the ass for the engineers to get approval to like, - [Pieter] I know. - Because it has to not break the rest of the site, whatever they do. But if you don't have enough dictatorial, like top down, like we need this now, it's gonna take forever to do anything multi-language audio. But multi-language audio is a good example of a thing that seems niche right now, but it quite possibly could change the entire world. When I upload this conversation right here, if instantaneously, it dubs it into 40 languages. - [Pieter] Yeah, man. - And everybody consume every single video can be watched and listened to in those different, it changes everything. And YouTube is extremely well-positioned to be the leader in this. - Yeah. - They got the compute, they got the user base, they have the experience of how to do this. So like multi-language audio should be- - High priority feature, right? - Yeah, that's high priority. - Yeah, yeah. - And it's a way, Google is obsessed with AI right now. They wanna show off that they could be dominant in AI. That's a way for Google to say like, we used AI. This is a way to break down the walls that language creates. - The preferred outcome for them is probably their career and not the overall result of the cool product. - I think they're not like selfish or whatever, they wanna do good. There's something about the machine- - The organization, yeah. - The organizational stuff that's just so I happens. - I have this when I report bugs on like big companies I work with. I talk to a lot of different people in DM and they're all really trying hard to do something. They're all really nice. And I'm the one being kind of asshole- - Yeah. - 'Cause I'm like, guys, I'm talking to 20 people about this for six months and nothing's happening. I say, "Man, I know but I'm trying my best." Yeah, so it's systemic. - Yeah, it requires, again, I don't know if there must be a nicer word, but like dictatorial type of top down the CEO rolls in and just says like, for you two, it's like MLA. - Yeah. - Get this done now. This is the highest priority. - I think big companies, especially in America, a lot of it's legal, right? They need to pass everything through legal. - Yeah. - And you can't like, man, the things I do, I could never do that in a big corporation, 'cause it's everything has to be probably Git deploy has to go through legal. - Well, again, dictatorial, you basically say Steve Jobs did this quite a lot. I've seen a lot of leaders do this. Ignore the lawyers. Ignore comms. - Exactly, yeah. - Ignore PR, ignore everybody. Give power to the engineers. Listen to the people on the ground, get this shit done, and get it done by Friday. - Yeah. - That's it. - And the law can change. For example, let's say you launch this AI dubbing and there's some legal problems with lawsuits. Okay, so the law changes, there will be appeals, there will be some Supreme Court thing, whatever. And the law changes. So just by shipping it you change society, you change the legal framework. And by not shipping, being scared of the legal framework all the time. You're not changing things. - Just outta curiosity, what ID do you use? Let's talk about like your whole setup. Given how ultra productive you are and that you often program in your underwear slouching on the couch. Does it matter to you in general? Is there like a specific ID you use you use VS Code? - Yeah, VS Code. Before I used Sublime Text, I don't think it matters a lot. I think I'm very skeptical of like tools when people think it... They say it matters, right? I don't think it matters. I think whatever tool you know very well, you go very, very fast and the shortcuts, for example, IDE. I love Sublime Text 'cause I could use multi-cursor, you search something and I could just like make mass replaces in a foul- - Yeah. - With the cursor thing, and VS Code doesn't really have that as well. - It's actually interesting. Sublime is the first editor where I've learned that. - [Pieter] Yeah. - And I think they just make that super easy. So what would that be called? Multi-edit, multi-cursors edit- - Yeah. - Thing whatever. - [Pieter] That's so good. - I'm sure like almost every editor can do that. It is just probably hard to set up. - Yeah. - And why so why need it? - VS Code is not so good, I think, Or at least I try it. But I would use that to like process data. Data sets, for example, from World Bank. I would just multi-cursor mass change everything, but yeah, VS Codes. Man, I was bullied into using VS Code, 'cause Twitter would always see my screenshots of Sublime Text and say, "Why are you still using Sublime Text?" Boomer, you need to use VS codes. - Yeah. - And I'm like, yeah, I'll try it. I got a new MacBook and then I never installed, I never copied the old MacBook. I just make it fresh, you know, like a clean, like format C Windows. Clean starts and I'm like, 'Okay, I'll try VS Code." And it stuck, you know, but I don't really care. It's not so important for me. - Wow, you know the format C reference, huh? - Dude, it was so good. You would install Windows and then after three or six months it would start breaking and everything was like get slow. Then you would restart, go to Dos, format C, you would delete your hard drive and then install the Windows 95 again, that was so good times. And you would design everything. Now I'm gonna install it properly. now I'm gonna design my desktop properly. - Yeah, I don't know if it's peer pressure, but like I used E-MAX for many, many years and I know, you know, I love Lisp. So a lot of the customization is done in Lisp. It's a programming language. And partially, it was peer pressure. But part of it's realizing like you need to keep learning stuff. The same issue with jQuery. I still think I need to learn Node.js, for example. - [Pieter] Yeah. - Even though that's not my main thing or even close to the main thing. But I feel like you need to keep learning this stuff. And even if you don't choose to use it long term, you need to give it a chance. So your understanding of the world expands. - Yeah, you wanna understand the new technological concepts and see if they can benefit you. It would be stupid not to even try it. - It's more about the concepts I would say than the actual tools. Like expanding, and that could be a challenging thing. So going to VS Code and like really learning it, like all the shortcuts, all the extensions, and actually installing different stuff and playing with it. That was a interesting challenge. It was uncomfortable at first. - Yeah, for me too, yeah. - Yeah, but you just dive in. - It's like neuro flex, like you keep your brain fresh, like this kind of stuff. - I gotta do that more. Have you given React a chance? (laughs) - No, but I wanna learn and I understand the basics, right? I don't really know where to start. - But would you like, I guess you gotta use your own model, which is like build the thing using it. - No, man, so I kind of did that. - Yeah. - The stuff I do in jQuery is essentially, a lot of it is like, I start rebuilding whatever tech is already out there. Not based on that, but just on accident. - Yeah. - I keep coding long enough that I built the same, I start getting the same problems everybody else has, and you start building the same frameworks kind of. So essentially, I use my own kind of framework of. - So you basically build a framework from scratch that's your own, that you understand it? - Kinda yeah. With HX calls, but essentially it's the same thing. Look, I don't have the time. I think saying you don't have the time is like always a lie, 'cause you just don't prioritize it enough. My priority is still like the running the businesses and improving that and AI. I think learning AI is much more valuable now than learning a front end framework. Yeah, It's just more impact. - I guess you should be just learning every single day a thing. - Yeah, you can learn a little bit every day. - Yeah. - Like a little bit of React, or I think now, like Next very big. So learn a little bit of Next. But I call them the military industrial complex. But you need to know, you need to know it anyway. - You gotta learn how to use the weapons of war and then you can be peacenik. - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, I mean, but you gotta learn it in the same exact way as we were talking about, which is learning by trying to build something with it and actually deploy it. - The frameworks are so complicated and it changes so fast. So it's like, where do I start? And I guess it's the same thing when you're starting out making websites. Where do you start? Ask GPT-4, I guess. Yeah, it's just so dynamic. It changes so fast that, and I dunno if it would be a good idea for me to learn it. Maybe some combination of like, few Next with PHP Laravel. Laravel is like a framework for PHP. I think that would be... It could benefit me. Maybe Tailwind for CSS, like a styling engine. That stuff could probably save me time. - Yeah, but like you won't know until you really give it a try. And it feels like you have to build, if maybe I'm talking to myself, but I should probably recode like my personal one page in Laravel. - [Pieter] Yeah. - And even though it might not have almost any dynamic elements, maybe have one dynamic element, but it has to go end to end in that framework. - Yeah. - Or like end to end build in Node.js. Some of it is, I don't... Figuring out how to even deploy the thing. - I have no idea. - Full stack. - All I know is right now I would send it to GitHub and it sends it to my server. I don't know how to get JavaScript running. I have no clue. - Yeah. - So I guess I need like a pass, like first an array, or Heroku kind of those kind of platforms. - I actually kind of just gave myself the idea of like, I kind of just wanna build a single webpage. Like one webpage that has one dynamic element and just do it in every single, in a lot of frameworks. Like just- - Ah, on the same page. - Same exact page. - All the same? - Kinda page. - It's smart. That's a cool project. You can learn all these frameworks. - Yeah. - And you can see the differences. - Yeah. - That's interesting, right? - That how long it takes to do it. - Yeah, stopwatch, yeah, yeah. - I have to figure out actually something sufficiently complicated, 'cause it should probably do, it should probably do some kind of thing where it accesses the database and dynamically changing stuff. - Some AI stuff, some LLM stuff. - Yeah, maybe some, it doesn't have to be AI LLM but maybe- - Do an API call. - API call to something. - Yeah, to replicate, for example. And then that would be a very cool project. - Yeah, yeah. And like time it and also report on my happiness. - Yeah. - I'm gonna totally do this - Because nobody benchmarks this. Nobody's benchmark developer happiness with frameworks. - [Lex] Yeah - Nobody's benchmarked the shipping time. - Just take like a month and do this. How many frameworks are there? How many? There's like five main ways of doing it. So there's like, this is no... There's backend, frontend. - And this stuff confused me too. Like React now apparently has become backend. - [Lex] Yeah. - Or something used to be on frontend, and you're forced to do now backend also. I don't know. But there's not really, you're not really forced to do anything. So according to the internet, so like there's no... It's actually not trivial to find the canonical way of doing things. So like the standard vanilla- - Yeah. - You go to the ice cream shop, there's like a million flavors. I want vanilla. If I've never had ice cream in my life, can we just like learn about ice cream? - Yeah. - I want vanilla. Nobody actually, sometimes they'll literally name it vanilla. But I wanna know what's the basic way, but not like dumb, but the standard canonical common. - Yeah, I know the dominant way- - [Lex] Yeah, the dominant way. - 60% of developers do it like this. - [Lex] Yeah. - It's hard to figure that out, that's the problem. - Yeah, maybe LLMs can help. Maybe you should explicitly ask what is the dominant? - Because they usually know the dominant, they give answers- - Yeah. - That are like the most probable kind of. - Yeah. - So that makes sense to ask LLM. I think honestly, maybe what would help is if you wanna learn or I would wanna learn a framework. Hire somebody that already does it and just sit with them and make something together. I've never done that, but I've thought about it. So it would be a very fast way to take their knowledge put them in my brain. - I've tried these kinds of things. What happens is it depends what kind of, if they're like a world class developer, yes. Oftentimes they themselves are used to that thing and they have not themselves explored in other options. So they're have this dogmatic talking down to you, - [Pieter] Yeah. (laughs) - This is the right way to do it. - Yeah. - It's like, no, no, no. We're just like exploring together. Okay, show me the cool thing you've tried, which is like, it has to have open-mindedness to like, Node.js is not the right way to do web development. It's like one way. And there's nothing wrong with the old lamp, PHP, jQuery, vanilla JavaScript way. It just has its pros and cons, and like- - Yeah. - You really you need to know what the pros and cons. - Those people exist. You could find those people probably. - Yeah. - If you wanna learn AI, imagine you have Karpathy sitting next to you- - Yeah. - Teach you, like he does these YouTube videos. It's amazing. He can teach it to like a five-year-old about how to make LLM. It's amazing. Imagine this guy sitting next to you and just teaching you like, let's make LLM together. Holy shit, it would be amazing. - Yeah, I mean, well, Karpathy has its own style and is like, I'm not sure he's for everybody, for example, a five-year-old. It depends on the five-year-old. - Yeah. - He's like super technical, - But he's amazing, 'cause he's super technical and he's the only one who can explain- - Yes. - The stuff in a simple way, which shows his complete genius. - Yes. - 'Cause if you can explain without jargon- - No BS. - You're like, wow. - And build it from scratch. - Yeah. it's like top tier. What a guy! - But he might be anti-framework 'cause he builds from scratch. - Actually, exactly, yeah. Actually he probably is, yeah. - He's like you, but for AI. - Yeah, so maybe learning a framework is a very bad idea for us. Maybe we should stay in PHP, and like Script kiddie and the- - But you have to... Maybe by learning the framework, you learn what you want to yourself, build from scratch. - Yeah, maybe you learn concepts, but you don't actually have to start using it for your life, right? Yeah, yeah. - And you're still a Mac guy or was a Mac guy? - Yeah, yeah, I switched to Mac in 2014, 'cause when I wanted to start traveling and my brother was like, "Dude, get a MacBook. It's like the standard now." I'm like, wow, I need to switch from Windows. And I had like three screens, Windows. - [Lex] Yeah. - I had this whole setup for music production. I had to sell everything. And then I had a MacBook, and I remember opening up this MacBook box, like aah, and it was so beautiful. It was like this aluminum, and then I opened it, I removed the screen protector thing. And it's so beautiful. And I didn't touch it for three days. I was just like, looking at it. - Yeah. - Really. And I was still on the Windows computer. And then I went traveling with that. And all my great things started when I switched to Mac, which sounds very dogmatic, right? - What great things are you talking about? - All the business started working out. I started traveling. I started building startups. I started making money. It all started when I switched to Mac. - Listen, I kinda... You're making me wanna switch to Mac. So I either use Linux inside Windows with WSL or just- - Yeah. - Ubuntu, Linux. But Windows for most stuff, like editing or any Adobe products. - Adobe stuff, right? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well you could use, I guess you could do Mac stuff there. - Yeah. - I wonder if I should switch. What do you miss about Windows? What was the pros and cons? - I think the Finder is horrible in Mac. - What is horrible? - The Finder. Oh, you don't know the Finder? So there's the Windows Explorer. - Yeah. - Windows Explorer is amazing. - Thank you for talking down. - Finder is strange, man. There's like strange things. There's this bug where if you send, like, attach a photo in WhatsApp or Telegram, it just selects the whole folder and you almost accidentally can click Enter and you send all your photos, all your files to this chat group, happened to my girlfriend. She starts sending me photo, photo, photo, photo, photo. So Finder is very unusable, but it has Linux. The whole thing is like, it's Unix based, right? - So you use the command like? - Yeah, all the time. Like all the time. And the cool thing is you can run, I think it's like Unix, like Debian or whatever. You can run most Linux stuff on macOS, which makes this very good for developments. I have my Nginx server, if I'm not lazy and set up my staging on my laptop, it's just the Nginx server. The same as I have on my cloud server, right? The same way the websites run. And I can use almost everything, the same config files, configuration files, and it just works. And that makes Mac a very good platform for Linux stuff, I think. - Yeah, yeah. - Real Ubuntu is like better of course. - Yeah, I'm in this weird situation where I'm somewhat of a power user in Windows, and let's say Android and all the much smarter friends I have all using Mac and iPhone. And it's like- - If you don't wanna go through the peer pressure. - It's not peer pressure. It's like one of the reasons I wanna have kids is that there's a lot of... I would love to have kids as a baseline, but there's like a concern. Maybe there's gonna be a trade off, or all this kind of stuff. But you see like these extremely successful smart people who are friends of mine, who have kids and are really happy they have kids. So that's not peer pressure, that's just like a strong signal. - Yeah, it works for people. - That works for people. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. And the same thing with Mac. It's like- - Yeah. (Lex exhales) - I don't see fundamentally, I don't like closed systems. So fundamentally, I like Windows more because there's much more freedom. Same with Android, there's much more freedom. - Yeah. - It's much more customizable. But like all the cool kids, the smart kids are using Mac and iPhones. All right, I need to really, I need to give it a real chance. Especially for development, since more and more stuff is done in the cloud anyway. - Yeah. - Well, anyway. But it's funny to hear you say all the good stuff started happening. Maybe I'll be like that guy too. When I switched to Mac, all the good stuff- - Yeah. - Started happening. - I think it's just about the hardware. It's just much about the software that- - Yeah. - The hardware is so well built, right? A keyboard and- - Yeah. But look at the keyboard I use. - Yeah, that's pretty cool. - That's one word for it. What's your favorite place to work? - On the couch. Does the couch matter? Is the couch at home or is it any couch? - No, like hotel couch also. In the room, right? - In the room. - Yeah, but I used to work like very ergonomically with like a standing desk. - Yeah. - And everything like perfect, like eye height, screen, blah, blah, blah. And I felt like, man, this has to do with lifting too. I started getting RSI like repetitive strain injury, like tingling stuff. And it would go all the way on my back. And I was sitting in a coworking space like 6:00 AM, sun comes up and I'm working and I'm coding, and I hear like a sound or something. So I do like, I look left and my neck gets stuck like (imitates cracking) and I'm like, wow, fuck! (Lex laughs) And I'm like, am I dying? And I thought, (Lex laughs) I'm probably dying. - Yeah, probably dying. - I don't wanna die in a cowork space. I'm gonna go home and die in like- - Yeah. - Peace and honor. - Yeah. - So I closed my laptop, and I put it in my backpack. - Yeah. - And I walked to the street. I got on my motorbike, went home. - Yeah. - And I lie down on like a pillow, with my legs up and stuff, to get rid of this like, 'cause it was my whole back. And it was because I was working like this all the time. - Yeah. - So I started getting like a, a laptop stand, everything. Ergonomically correct. But then I started lifting and since then, it seems like everything gets straightened out. Your posture kinda, you're more straight. And I never have RSI anymore, repetitive injury. I never have tingling anymore. No pains and stuff. So then I started working on the sofa and it's great. It feels close to the... I sit like this. - Yeah. - Legs together and then a pillow and then a laptop. And then I work. - Are you like leaning back? - I'm kind of like, together like legs, and then- - Where's the mouse? - No, so everything is tracked on the macOs, the MacBook. I used to have the Logitech MX mouse, the perfect ergonomic mouse. So you're just doing like this little thing with the thing. - Yes. - One screen. - One screen. And I used to have three screens. I know where people come from. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I had all the stuff, but then I realized that having it all condensed in one laptop, it's a 16 inch MacBook. So it's quite big. But having it one there is amazing, 'cause you're so close to the tools, you're so close to what's happening. It's like working on a car or something. Man, if you have trees, you to look here, look there, you get also neck injury actually. - Well, I don't know. This sounds like you're part of a cult, and you're just trying to convince me. I mean, but it's good to hear that you can be ultra productive on a single screen. - Yeah. - I mean that's crazy. - Come on tap, you all tap, Windows is all up tap, macros Command + Tap, you switch very fast. - So you have like one, the entire screen is taken out by VS Code. Say you look at the code and then- - Yeah. - And then if you deploy like a website, you what? Switch screens. - Command + Tap to Chrome. I used to have this swipe screen, you could do like different screen. - Yeah, yeah. - Spaces. - Yeah. - I was like, "Ah, it's too difficult." Let's just put it all on one screen on the MacBook and then. - And you can be productive that way? - Yeah, very productive, yeah. More productive than before. - Interesting. Because I have three screens, then two of them are vertical. Like on the size? - Yeah, code, right, yeah. - For the code, you can see a lot. - Yeah. No man, I love it. I love seeing it with friends. They have amazing like battle stations, right? - Yeah. - It's called. It's amazing. I want it but I don't want it, right? - So you like the constraints. - [Pieter] That's it. - There's some aspect of the constraints, which like once you get good at it, you can focus your mind and you can. - Man, I'm suspicious of like more. - Yeah. - Do you really need all the stuff? It might slow me down, actually. - It's a good way to put it. I'm suspicious of more, me too. - [Pieter] Yeah. - I'm suspicious of more in all ways, in all walks of life. - 'Cause you can defend more, right? You can defend. Yeah, I'm a developer, I make money. I need to get more screens, right? I need to be more efficient. And then you read stuff about "Mythical Man-Month," where like hiring more people slows down a software project that's famous. Think you can use a metaphor maybe for tools as well. Then I see friends just with gear acquisition syndrome that buying so much stuff, but they're not that productive. They have the best, most beautiful battle stations, desktops, everything. They're not that productive. And it's also like kind of fun. It's all from my laptop in a backpack, right? - Yeah. - It's kinda nomad minimalist. - Take me through like the perfect ultra productive day in your life. Say like where you get a lot of shit done. - Yeah. - And it's all focused on getting shit done. When are you waking up? Is it a regular time? Super early, super late? - Yes, so I go to sleep like 2:00 AM usually, something like that. And before 4:00 AM, but my girlfriend would go sleep midnight. So we did a compromise like 2:00 AM you know, so I wake up around 10, 11. The more like 10, shower, make coffee, I make coffee, like drip coffee, like the V60, you know the filter. And I'd boil water and then I put the coffee in, and then chill, live with my girlfriend and then open laptops, start coding, check what's going on, like bugs or whatever. - How long are you, like how stretches of time are you able to just sit behind the computer coding? - So I used to need like really long stretches where I would do like all nighters and stuff to get shit done. But I've gotten trained to like have more interruptions where I can like- - Because you have to. - This is life. There's a lot of distractions. Your girlfriend asks stuff, people come over, whatever. - Yeah. - So I'm very fast now, I can lock in and lock out quite fast. And heard people, developers or entrepreneurs with kids have the same thing. Before they're like, ah, I cannot work, but they get used to it, and they get really productive in like short time, because they only have like 20 minutes and then shit goes crazy again. So another constraint, right? - Yeah, it's funny. - So I think that works for me, but yeah. And then cook food and stuff, like have lunch, steak and chicken and whatever. - Do you eat a bunch of times a day? So you said coffee. - Yeah. - What are you doing? - Yeah, so a few hours later cook foods. We get like locally stores like meat and stuff and vegetables and cook that, and then second coffee and then go some more. Maybe go outside for lunch. You can mix fun stuff. - How many hours are you saying a perfectly productive day? Are you doing programming? If you were like to kill it? Are you doing like all day basically? - You mean like the special days where like- - Special days. - Girlfriend leaves to like bears or something, and you're alone for a week at home. Which is amazing. - Yes. - You can just code. And you stay up all night and eat chocolate and- - Yeah, chocolate. - Yeah, you know. - Yeah, yeah, okay, okay. Let's remove girlfriend from picture. Social life from picture. It's just you. - Man, then goes shit crazy. - Yeah, because when shit goes crazy. - Yeah, now shit goes crazy. - Okay, good. Let's rewind. Are you still waking up? There's coffee, there's no girlfriend to talk to. There's no- - Now we wake up (Lex and Pieter laughs) Like 1:00 PM or 2:00 PM. (Lex laughs) - Because you went to bed at 6:00 AM. - Yeah, because I was coding, I was finding some new AI shit. - Yeah, yeah. - And I was studying it, and it was amazing. And I cannot sleep 'cause it's too important. We need to stay awake. - Yeah, yeah. - We need to see all of this. We need to make something now. But that's the times I do make new stuff more, so I think I have a friend, he actually books a hotel for like a week to leave his, and he has a kid too, and his girlfriend and his kids stay in the house and he goes to another hotel. Sounds a little suspicious, right? Going to the hotel. But all he does (Lex laughs) is like writing or coding. - Yeah. - He's a writer, and he needs like this alone time, this silence. And I think for this flow state, it's true. I'm better maintaining stuff when there's a lot of disruptions then like creating new stuff. I need this. And it's common, it's close. It's this uninterrupted period of time. So yeah, I wake up like one, 2:00 PM, still coffee, shower. We still shower, you know, and then this code like nonstop. Maybe my friends comes over anyway. - Just some distraction. - Yeah, Andre, he codes too. So he comes over, we code together, we listen... It starts going back to like the Bali days, you know, like- - Yeah. - Coworking days. - You're not really working with him, but you're just both working. - Because it's nice to have like the vibe where you both sit together on the couch and coding on something and you actually, it's mostly silent or there's music, and sometimes you ask something. But generally, you are really locked in. - What music are you listening to? - I think like techno, like YouTube techno. There's a channel called HOR with Umlaut, HO like double dot. It's Berlin techno, whatever. It looks like they film it in like a toilet with like white tiles and stuff. And it's very cool. And they always have like, very good, kind of industrial. - Industrial, so fast phase. - Kinda aggressive, like (imitates techno music) - Yeah, yeah. That's not distracting to you brain. - That's amazing. - Okay. - I think distracting, man, jazz. I listen coffee jazz with my girlfriend when I wake up and it's kind of like, this piano starts getting annoying. It's like (imitates jazz music). (Lex laughs) It's too many tones. It's like, too many things go on. - [Lex] Yeah, yeah. - This industrial techno is like, you know, these African rain dances. (imitates techno music) It's this transcendental- - Yeah. - Trans. - That's interesting, 'cause I actually mostly now listen to brown noise, noise. - Yeah, wow. - Pretty loud. - Wow. - And one of the things you learn is your brain gets used to whatever. So I'm sure to techno, if I actually give it a real chance. - [Pieter] Yeah. - My brain would get used to it. But like with noise, what happens is something happens to your brain. I think there's a science to it, but I don't really care. You just have to be a scientist of one. Study yourself, your own brain. Yeah. - For me, it does something. I discovered it right away when I tried it for the first time. After about like a couple minutes, every distraction just like disappears. And it goes like (imitates pressure deflating) You can like hold focus on things like really well. It's weird. You can like really focus on a thing. It doesn't really matter what that is. I think that's what people achieve with like meditation. You can like focus on your breath, for example, for so long. - It's just normal brown noise. It's not like binaural. - No, it's just normal brown noise. - It's like shhhh. - Yeah. - White noise, I think it's same. It's like make noise, white noise. Brown noise I think is when it's like bassier. - Yeah, it's more diffused. More dampened. - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - Dampened. - Yeah, I can see that. - No sharpness. - Yeah, sharp brightness. - Yeah, brightness. - Yeah, I can see that. And you use a headphones, right? - Yeah, headphones. - Yeah. - I actually like, walk around in life often with brown noise. - Dude, that's like psycho batshit. But it's cool. (Lex laughs) - Yeah, yeah, yeah. When I murder people, it helps. (Lex laughs) It drowns out their screams. - Jesus Christ. - I'm sorry, I said too much. - Man, I'm gonna try brown noise. - With a murder or for the coding? Yeah. - For the coating, yeah. - Okay, good. Try it, try it. But you have to like, with everything else, you give it a real chance. - Yeah. - I also, like I said, do techno type stuff. Electronic music on top of the brown noise, but then control the speed, 'cause the faster it goes, the more anxiety. So if I really need to get shit done, especially with programming, I'll have a beat. - Yeah. - And it's great. It's cool. Say is cool to play those little tricks of your mind to study yourself. - Yeah. - I usually don't like to have people around, 'cause when people, even if they're working, I don't know, I like people too much. They're like, interesting. - There might be, yeah. In coworker space, I would just start talking too much. - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - So there's a source of distraction. - Yeah, in the cowork space, we would do like a money pot, like a mug. So we'd work for 45 minutes and then if you would say, like pair of words, you would get a fine, which is like $1. So you'd put $1 to say, "Hey, what's up?" So $3 you put in the mug, and then 15 minutes free time. We can like party, whatever. And then 45 minutes again working. And that works. But you need to shut people up or they, you know. - I think there's an intimacy in being silent together- - [Pieter] Yeah. - Maybe I'm uncomfortable with. If you need to make yourself vulnerable and actually do it, like with close friends to just sit there in silence for long periods of time. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - And like doing a thing. - Dude, I watched this video of this podcast. It was like this Buddhism podcast with people meditating, and they were interviewing each other or whatever, and like a podcast. And suddenly after a question, it's like, yeah, yeah. And they were just silent for like three minutes. And then they said it was amazing. Yeah, it was amazing. I was like, wow, pretty cool. - Elon is like that. And I really like that, he'll ask a question. I don't know, what's a perfectly productive day for you? Like I just asked, and you just sit there for like 30 seconds thinking. - Yeah, he thinks. - Yeah, I don't know. - That's so cool. I wish I could think more about, but I wanna show you my heart. I wanna show you... go straight from my heart to my mouth to like saying the real thing. And the more I think the more I start like filtering myself, right? And I wanna just throw it out there immediately. - I do that more with team. I think he has a lot of practice in that. I do that as well. And in team setting, when you're thinking, brainstorming. - Yeah. - And you allow yourself to just like, think in silence. - Yeah. - Just like, 'cause even in meetings, people wanna talk. - [Pieter] Yeah. - It's like, no, you think before you speak and just like, it's okay to be silent together. - [Pieter] Yeah. - And if you allow yourself the room to do that, you can actually come up with really good ideas. - Yeah. - So, okay, this perfect day, (laughs) how much caffeine are you consuming in this day? - Man, too much, right? Because normally like two cups of coffee. But on this perfect day, we go to four maybe. So we're starting to hit the anxiety levels. - So four cups is a lot for you? - Well, I think my coffees are quite strong when I make them. It's like 20 grams of coffee powder in the V60. So my friends call 'em like nuclear coffee 'cause it's quite heavy. - Yeah, super strong. - It's quite strong. But it's nice to hit that anxiety level where you're like almost panic attack. - Yeah. - But you're not there yet. But that's like, man, it's like super locked in. Just like (imitates intense music) It's amazing. But I mean there's a space for that in my life. But I think it's great for making new stuff. It's amazing. - Starting from scratch, creating a new thing. - Yes, I think girlfriends should let their guys go away for like two weeks. Every few, no, every year at least. Maybe every quarter, I dunno. And just sit and make some shit without, they're amazing but like no disturbance. Just be alone. And then people can make something very, very amazing. - Just wearing cowboy hats in the mountains like we showed. - Exactly, we can do that. - There's a movie about that. - With the laptops. - They didn't do much programming though. - Yeah, you can do a little bit of that. - Okay. - And then a little bit of shipping. You could do both. - It's a different, "Brokeback Mountain." - They need to allow us to go. They need like a man cave, right? - Yeah, to ship. - Yeah, to ship. (Lex laughs) - Get shit done, yeah. It's a balance, okay, cool. What about sleep, naps and all that? You not sleeping much? - I don't do naps in the day. I think power naps are good, but I'm never tired anymore in the day. Man, also 'cause of gym, I'm not tired. I'm tired when I wanna... When it's night, I need to sleep. - Yeah, me, I love naps. - I sleep very well. - I love naps. - Yeah. - I don't care. I don't know. I don't know why, brain shuts off, turns on. I dunno if it's healthy or not. It just works. - Yeah. - I think with anything mental, physical, you have to be a student of your own body and like- - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Know what the limits are. You have to be skeptical taking advice from the internet in general, 'cause a lot of the advice is just like a good baseline for the general population. - It's not personalized, yeah. - You have to become a student of your own- - Yeah. - Like of your own body, of your own self, of how you work, yeah. I've done a lot of and just like, for me, fasting was an interesting one, because I used to eat a bunch of meals a day, especially when I was lifting heavy. 'Cause everybody says, "You have to eat," kind of a lot, multiple meals a day. But I realize I can get much stronger, feel much better if I eat once or twice a day on. - Yeah, me too, yeah. - It's crazy. - I never understood this small meal thing, yeah. It didn't work for me. - Well, let me just ask you, it'd interesting if you can comment on some of the other products you've created. We talked about Nomad List, Interior AI, Photo AI, Therapist AI. What's RemoteOK? - It's a job board for remote jobs. Because back then, like 10 years ago there was job boards, but it was not really specifically remote job, job boards. So I made one... First of all, Nomad List is I made like nomad jobs, like a page. And a lot of companies started hiring and they pay for job posts. So I spin it off to RemoteOK. And now it's like this number one or number two biggest remote job boards. And it's also fully automated and people just post a job and people apply. It has like profiles as well. It's kinda like LinkedIn for remotes work. - So's focus on remote only. - Yeah. It's essentially like a simple job board. I discover job boards are way more complicated than you think. Yeah, it's a job board for remote jobs. (Lex laughs) But the nice thing is you can charge a lot of money for job posts. Man, it's good money. B2B, you can charge like, you start with 299. But at the peak when the Fed started printing money, 2021. I was making like 140K a month with RemoteOK, with just job posts. And I started like adding crazy upsells, like rainbow color, it's job posts. You can add your background images. - Yeah. - It's just upsells man. And you charge $1,000 for an upsell. It was crazy. And all these companies is up so up. So yeah, we want everything. Job post would cost 3,000, $4,000. And I was like, this is good business. And then the Fed stopped printing money and it all went down, and it went down to like 10K a month from 140. - Yeah. - Now it's back. I think it's like 40. It was good times. - I gotta ask you about back to the digital nomad life. - [Pieter] Yeah. - You wrote a blog post on the reset. And in general, just giving away everything, living a minimalist life. - Yeah. - What did it take to do that, like to get rid of everything? - 10 years ago was like this trend in the blog. Back then blogs were so popular. It was a blogosphere, and it was like 100 things challenge. - What is that? The 100 things challenge. - I mean, it's ridiculous. But like you write down every object you have in your house and you count it, you make a spreadsheet and you're like, "Okay, I have 500 things." You need to get it down to 100. Why? This just the trend, so I did it. I started like selling stuff, started throwing away off. And I did like MDMA and ecstasy like 2012 kind of. And after that trip, I felt so different, and I felt like I had to start throwing shit away. I swear. - Yeah. - And I started throwing shit away. And I felt that was like, it was almost the drug sending me to a path of like, you need to throw all your shit away. You need to start go on a journey. You need to get out of here. And that's what the MDMA did, I think, yeah. - How hard is it to get down to 100 items? - Boy, you need to like, sell your PC and stuff. You need to go on eBay and then, man, going eBay, selling all your stuff is balancing, 'cause you discover society. You meet the craziest people. You meet every range from rich to poor, everybody comes to your house to buy stuff. It's so funny, so interesting. I recommend everybody do this. - Just to meet people that want your shit. - Yeah, it was so like, I didn't know, I wasn't living in Amsterdam, and I didn't know, I have my own subculture or whatever. And I discovered the Dutch people, like as they are from eBay. So I sold everything. - What's the weirdest thing you had to sell and you had to find a buyer for, not the weirdest, but like, what's memorable? - So back then I was making music and we would make music videos with like a Canon 5D camera. - Yeah. - Back then everybody's making films and musicals. And we bought it with my friends and stuff. And it was kind of like, I had to sell this thing too, 'cause it was very expensive. It was like 6K or something. - [Lex] Yeah. - But it meant that selling this, meant that we wouldn't make music theater anymore. I would leave Holland. This kind of stuff we were working on would end. And I was kind of saying this music theater stuff, we're not getting famous in this or successful. We need to stop doing this. This music production also, it's not really working. And it was kinda like, felt very bad for my friends, 'cause we would work together on this and to sell this camera that we'd make stuff with. - It was a hard goodbye. - It was just a camera, but it was like, it felt like, sorry guys, it doesn't work and I need to go. - Who bought it? Do you remember? It was some guy who couldn't possibly understand the journey. - The emotion of it. - Yeah. - Yeah. - He just showed up, here's the money, thanks. - Yeah, but it was like cutting your life. This shit ends now and now we gonna do new stuff. - I think it's beautiful. I did that twice in my life. I give away everything, everything, everything. - Wow. - Like down to just pants, underwear, backpack. - Yeah. - I think it's important to do. It shows you what's important. - Yeah, I think that's what I learned from it. You learn that you can live a very little objects very little stuff, but there's a counter to it. You lean more on the stuff, on the services, right? Like for example, you don't need a car, you use Uber, right? Or you don't need kitchen stuff because you go to restaurants when you're traveling. So you lean more on other people's services, but spend money on that as well. So that's good. - Yeah, but just letting go of material possessions, which it gives a kind of freedom to how you move about the world. - Yeah. - It gives you complete freedom to go into another city to- - Yeah, with your backpack. - The backpack. - Yeah. - There's a kind of freedom to it. There's something about material possessions and having a place and all that, that ties you down a little bit. - Yeah. - Like spiritually. - Yeah. - It's good to take a leap alternate into the world. Especially when you're younger to like. - Man, I recommend if you're 18, you get out of high school, do this, go travel, and build some internet stuff, whatever. Bring your laptop. It's amazing experience. Five years ago, it's still good in university, but now I'm thinking like, no, maybe skip university. Just go first, like travel around a little bit, figure some stuff out. You can go back to university when you're 25. You can like, okay, now I learned, I'd be successful in business. You have money at least. Now you can choose what you really wanna study. Because people at 18, they go study what's probably good for the job market, right? So it probably makes more sense. If you want that, go travel, build some businesses, and go back to university if you want. - So one of the biggest uses of a university is the networking. You gain friends, you gain, like you meet people. It's a forcing function to meet people. But if you can meet people out to the world- - Travel. - By travel. - Man, and you meet so many different cultures. - I mean, the problem for me is like if I traveled at that young age, I'm attracted to people at the outskirts of the world. Like for me- - Like where? - Not geographically. - Oh, like the subcultures. - Yeah, like the weirdos, the darkness. - Yeah. Yeah, me too. - But that might not be the best networking at 18 years old. (Lex and Pieter laughs) - No, man, if you're smart about it, you can stay safe. And I met so many weirdos from traveling. That's how travel works. If you really let loose, you meet the craziest people. - [Pieter] Yeah. - And it's the most interesting people. And I cannot recommend it enough. - Well see, the other thing is that when you're 18, I feel like depending on your personality, you have to learn both how to be a weirdo and how to be a normie. You still have to learn how to fit into society. - [Pieter] Yeah. - For a person like me, for example, who's always an outcast. There's always a danger for going full outcast. - [Pieter] Yeah. - And that's a harder life if you, if you go to like, go full artists in full like darkness, it's just a harder life. - You can come back, you can come back to normie. - That's a skill. I think you have to learn- - You think? - How to fit in to polite society. - But I was very strange outcast as well. And I'm more adaptable to normie now. - You learned it, yeah, learned it. - After 30s, you're like, yeah. - But you need a skill, you have to learn. - Yeah. Man, I feel also that, you start as an outcast, but the more you work on yourself, the less like shit you have. You kind of start becoming more normie, because you become more chill with yourself and more happy. And it kind of makes you uninteresting, right? - Yes. - A little bit. - Yes, yes. - The crazy people are always the most interesting. If you've solved your internal struggles and you therapy and stuff and you kind of become kind of, you know, it's not so interesting anymore maybe. - You don't have to be broken to be interesting, I guess is what I'm saying. - Yeah. - What kind of things were left when you minimalized? - So the backpack. - Yeah. - MacBook, toothbrush, some clothes, underwear, socks. - [Lex] Yeah. - You don't need a lot of clothes in Asia 'cause it's hot. So you just wear swim pants, swim shorts. You walk around flip flops. So very basic, T-shirt, and go to the laundromat and wash my stuff. And I think it was like 50 things or something, yeah. - Yeah, it's nice. As I mentioned to you, there's the show alone. - Yeah. - They really test you, 'cause, oh, you only get 10 items, and you have to survive out in the wilderness. And then ax, like everybody brings an ax. Some people also have a saw. - Wow. - But usually ax does the job. You basically have to, in order to build a shelter, you have to cut down and to cut the trees and make, and like- - Learn Minecraft. - Everything I learned about life, (Pieter laughs) I learn Minecraft, bro. Yeah, yeah, you could. It's nice to create those constraints for yourself to understand what matters to you and also how to be in this world. And one of the ways to do that is just to live a minimalist life. But some people, I've met people that really enjoy material possessions and that brings some happiness, and that's a beautiful thing. - Yeah. - For me, it doesn't, but people are different. - It gives me happiness for like two weeks. - [Lex] Yeah. - I'm very quickly adapting to like a baseline. Hedonistic adaptation very fast. - Yeah. - But man, if you look at the studies, most people like get a new car six months, get a new house six months, you just feel the same. She's like, wow, should I buy all this stuff? Studying hedonistic adaptation made me think a lot about minimalism. - And so that you don't even need to go through the whole journey of getting it. Just focus on the thing that's more permanent. - Yeah. - Like building shit. - Yeah, like people around you, like people you love. Nice food, nice experiences. - Yeah. - Meaningful work, those things. Exercise, those things make you happy, I think. Make me happy for sure. - You wrote a blog post, "Why I'm unreachable and maybe you should be too." What's your strategy on communicating with people? - Yeah, so when I wrote that, I was getting so many DMs (Lex laughs) as you probably have, you have a million times more, and people were getting angry that I wasn't responding and I was like, "Okay, I'll just close down these DMs completely. And people got angry that I closed my DMs down, that I'm not like man of the people. - It's like you changed man. - Yeah, you've changed. You got, you know, like this. And I'm like, I'll explain why. I just don't have the time in a day to answer every question. And also people send you like crazy shit, man. Stalkers and like, people write their whole life story for you and then ask you advice. Man, I have no idea. I'm not a therapist. I don't know, I don't know this stuff. - But also beautiful stuff. - Absolutely, sure. - Life story. I've posted a coffee forum, if you wanted to have a coffee with me. - Nice. - And I've gotten an extremely large number of submissions and when I look at them, there's just like beautiful people in there. - Yeah, stories. - Beautiful human beings. - [Pieter] Yeah. - There's really powerful stories and breaks my heart that I won't get to meet those people. - Yeah. - And so this part of it is just like, there's only so much bandwidth to truly see other humans and help them or understand them or hear them or yeah, see them. - Yeah, I have this problem that I try... I wanna try help people and also like, oh- - Yeah. - Let's make startups and whatever. And I've learned over the years that generally for me, and it sounds maybe bad, right? But I helped my friend Andre, for example, he came up to me in a cowork space. That's how I met him. And he said, "I wanna learn to code. I wanna do startups, how do I do it?" I said, "Okay, let's go install Nginx. Let's start coding." And he has this self-energy that he actually... He doesn't need to be pushed, he just goes and he just goes and he ask questions and he doesn't ask too many questions. He just goes, goes and learns it. And now he has a company and makes a lot of money, has his own startups. And the people that I had to kind of like, that ask me for help, but then I gave help and then they started debating it. - Yeah. - Do you have that? People ask you advice and they go against you say, "No, you're wrong, because." I'm like, "Okay, bro, I don't wanna debate. You asked me for advice," right? And the people need to push generally, it doesn't happen. - Yeah. - You need to have this energy for yourself. - Well, they're searching. They're searching, they're trying to figure it out. But oftentimes their search, if they successfully find what they're looking for, it'll be within. It sounds very like spiritual boost. - [Pieter] Yeah. - But it's really like figuring that shit out on your own. - Yeah. - But they're reaching, they're trying to ask the world around them. How do I live this life? How do I figure this out? But ultimately, the answer is gonna be from them working on themselves. And literally, it's the stupid thing, but Googling and doing like searching- - Yeah, surfing is procrastination. I think sending messages to people. - Yeah. - Is a lot of procrastination. Lex, how do you become successful podcaster? - Yeah. - Bro, just start. Just go. - Yeah. And just go. - I would never ask you how to be successful podcaster? I would just start it, and then I would copy your methods. I would say, "Ah, this guy's a Black background. We probably need this as well." - Yeah, try it. - Yeah. - Yeah, try. And then you realize it's not about the Black background, it's about something else. So you find your own voice, just keep trying stuff. - Exactly. - Meditation is a difficult thing. Like a lot of people copy and they don't move past it. - Yeah. - You should understand their methods and then move past it. - Yeah. - Find yourself, find your own voice. Find your own. - Yeah, you imitate and then you put your own spin to it, and that's like creative process. That's literally the whole create... Everybody always builds on the previous work. - Yeah. - You shouldn't get stuck. - [Lex] 24 hours in a day, eight hours of sleep. You break it down into a math equation. 90 minutes of showering, clean up, coffee. It just keeps whittling down to zero. - Man, it's not this specific, but I had to make like an average or something. - Yeah. Firefighting (laughs) oh, I like that. One hours of groceries and errands. I've tried breaking down minute by minute, what I do in a day. - Yeah. - Especially when my life was simpler. It's really refreshing to understand where you waste a lot of time. - Yeah. - And what you enjoy doing. How many minutes it takes to be happy? (laughs) - Yeah. - Doing the thing that makes you happy and how many minutes it takes to be productive? And you realize there's a lot of hours in the day- - Yeah. - If you spend it right. - Yeah, a lot of it's wasted, yeah. - For me, it's been the biggest battle for the longest time is finding stretches of time where I can deeply focus into really, really deep work. Just like zoom in and completely focused, cutting away all the distractions. - Yeah, me too. - That's the battle. - Yeah. - It's unpleasant. It's extremely unpleasant. - We need to fly to an island, make a man cave island where we can just, everybody can just code for a week, and just get shit done. Make new projects. - Yeah, yeah. - But man, they called me psychopaths for this, 'cause it says like one hours of sex, hugs, love. Man, I had to write something, and they were like, "Oh, this guy's psychopath." He plans his sex in specific hour- - Like hugs. - Bro, I don't. - A counter for hugs. - Yeah, exactly. Yeah, like click, click, click. - It's just a numerical representation of what life is. - Yeah. - It's like one of those, when you draw out how many weeks you have in a life. - Oh, dude, this is like dark. Yeah, man, don't wanna look at that too much. - Holy shit. - Yeah, man. (Lex laughs) How many times you see your parents? Jesus, man. - Yeah. - It's scary, man. - That's right. It might be only a handful more times. - [Pieter] Yeah, man. - You just look at the math of it. If you see him once a year or twice a year. - Yeah, FaceTime today. - Yeah. - Yeah. - I mean, that's like dark when you see somebody you like seeing, like a friend that's on the outskirts of your friend group. And then you realize like, well, I haven't really seen him for like three years. So how many more times do we have- - Yeah. - That we see each other? - Do you believe that like, friends just slowly disappear from your life? Your friend group evolves, right? - [Lex] So it does, it does. - There's a problem with Facebook, you get all these old friends from school, when you were 10 years old. - Yeah. - Back when Facebook started. You would add friend them and then you're like, why are we in touch again? Just keep the memories there. It's different life now. - Yeah, that might be a guy thing or I don't know. There's certain friends I have that like, we don't interact often, but we're still friends. - Yeah. - Every time I see him I think it's because we have a foundation of many shared experiences. - Yeah. - And many memories. I guess it's like nothing has changed. Almost like, we've been talking every day, even if we haven't talked for a year. - Yeah, yeah, that's deep. - Yeah. - Issues. - So I don't have to be interacting with them for them to be in a friend group. And then there's some people I interact with a lot. So it depends, but there's just this network of good human beings that I can. - [Pieter] Yeah. - Yeah, they have like a real love for them. And I can always count on them, if any of them called me in the middle of the night, I'll get rid of a body, I'm there. I like how that's a different definition of friendship, but it's true, it's true. - True friend. - You've become more and more famous recently. How's that affect you? - It's not recently because it's this gradual thing, right? It keeps going, and I also don't know why it's keeps going. - Does that put pressure on you to, 'cause you're pretty open on Twitter and you're just like basically building shit in the open. - Yeah. - And just not really caring if it's too technical, if it's any of this just being out there, does it put pressure on you? Is it become more popular to be a little bit more collected and? - Man, I think the opposite, right? 'Cause the people I follow are interesting, 'cause they say whatever they think and they ship or whatever. It's so boring that people start tweeting only about one topic. - Yeah. - I don't know anything about their personal life. I wanna know about their personal life. Like you do podcasts, you ask about life stuff of personality. That's the most interesting part of business or sports. What's the behind the sport, the athlete, right? Behind the entrepreneur. - Yeah. - That's interesting stuff. - To be human. - Yeah. I shared a tweet went too far, but we were cleaning the toilet 'cause the toilet was clogged. But it's just real stuff, 'cause Jensen Huang, the Nvidia guy, he says, he started cleaning toilets. - That was cool. You tweeted something about the Denny's thing, I forget. - Yeah, it was recent. Nvidia was started in a Denny's diner table. - And you made it somehow profound. - [Pieter] Yeah, this one, this one. - Nvidia, a $3 trillion company was started in a Denny's, an American diner. People need a third space to work on their laptops to build the next billion or trillion dollar company. What's the first and second space? - The home office. - And then the in between. The island. - Yeah, I guess, yeah. - The island. - Yeah. You need a space to like congregate. Man, and I found history on this. So 400 years ago in the coffee house of Europe. The scientific revolution, the enlightenment happened because they would go to coffee houses, they would sit there, they would drink coffee and they would work. They would work. They would write and they would do debates and they would organize marine routes, right? They would do all the stuff in Coffeehouse in Europe, in France, in Austria, in UK, in Holland. So we were always going to cafes to work and to have serendipitous conversations with other people and start business and stuff. And like you asked me to come on here and we flew to America, and the first thing I realized was that I've been to America before, but we were in this cafe and there's a lot of laptops. Everybody's working on something. And I took this photo, and then when you're in Europe, like large parts of Europe now, you cannot use a laptop anymore. It's like no laptop. Which I understand. - But that is to you, a fundamental place to create shit. Isn't that natural, organic coworking space of a coffee? - Well, for a lot of people. A lot of people have very small homes- - [Lex] Yeah. - And coworking spaces are kind of boring. They're private. They're not serendipitous, kinda boring. Cafes are amazing 'cause random people can come in and ask you what are you working on, or you know. And not just laptops, people are also having conversations like they did 400 years ago debates or whatever. Things are happening. And man, I understand the aesthetics of it. It's like, oh, startup bro, shipping is a bullshit startup. But there's something more there. There's people actually making stuff, making new companies that the society benefits from. We're benefiting from Nvidia. I think it's the US GDP for sure is benefiting from Nvidia, European GDB could benefit if we build more companies. And I feel in Europe there's this vibe and you have to connect things. But not allowing laptops in cafes is kind of like part of the vibe, which is like, yeah, we're not really here to work. We're here to like enjoy life. I agree with this Anthony Bourdain, like this tweet was quote to Anthony Bourdain photo of him with cigarettes and a coffee in France. And he said, "This is what the cafes are for." I agree. - But there is some element of like entrepreneurship. You have to allow people to dream big and work their ass off towards that dream. And then feel each other's energy as they interact with. - [Pieter] Yes. - That's one of the things I liked in Silicon Valley when I was working there, is the cafes. - Yeah. - There's a bunch of dreamers. You can make fun of them for like, everybody thinks they're gonna build- - Sure. - A trillion dollar company, but like- - Yeah, and it's off. It's not everybody wins. 99% of people- - Yeah. - Will be bullshit. - But they're working their ass off. - Yeah, and they're doing something, and you need to pass this StartupBros. Oh, it's StartupBros level. No, it's not. It's people making cool shit. - Yeah. - And this will benefit you 'cause this will create jobs for your country and your region. And I think in Europe that's a big problem. We have a very anti-entrepreneurial mindset. - Dream big and build shit. - Yeah. - I mean this is really inspiring. This has been tweet of yours. All the projects that you've tried and the ones that succeeded. - Has very few. - Mute life. - [Pieter] It was for Twitter to share the mute list. - Yeah. - Your mute words. - Fire calculator. No more Google, make a rank. How much is my site project worth? Climate Finder, Ideas AI. - AirlineList still runs, but it doesn't make money. AirlineList like compares the safety of airlines because I was nervous to fly. So I was like, let's collect all the data on crashes for all the airplanes. - Bali sea cable. Nice, that's awesome. Make village, nomad gear, 3D, and virtual reality dev, play in my inbox like you mentioned. There's a lot of stuff. - Yeah, man. - I'm trying to find some embarrassing tweets of yours. - You can go to the highlight tab. It has all like the good shit kind. - There you go. - This was Dubai. - POV, building an AI startup. Wow, you're a real influencer. - (laughs) And if people copy this photo now and they change the screenshots. It becomes like a meme. (Lex laughs) Of course, you know. - (laughs) This is good. - That's how Dubai looks, it's insane. - That's beautiful. Architectural wise. It's crazy. The story behind these cities. - Yeah, the story behind for sure. So this is about the European economy where like. - European economy landscape is ran by dinosaurs, and today I studied this so I can produce you with my evidence. 80% of top EU companies were founded before 1950. Only 36% of top US companies were founded before 1950. - Yeah, so the median founding of companies in US is something like 1960, and the top companies, right? And the median in Europe is like 1,900 or something. - Yeah. - So it's here 1913 and 1963. So there's a 50th difference. - It's a good representation of the very thing you were talking about, the difference in the cultures, entrepreneurial, spirit of the peoples. - But Europe used to be entrepreneurial. There was companies founded in 1800, 1850, 1900. It flipped like around 1950 where America took the lead. And I guess my point is like, I hope that Europe gets back to, 'cause I'm European, I hope that Europe gets back to being an entrepreneurial culture where they build big companies again. 'Cause right now, all the old dinosaur companies control the economies. They're lobbying with the government. Europe is also, they're infiltrated with the government where they create so much regulation, I think it's called regulatory capture, right? Where it's very hard for a newcomer to join and to enter an industry because there's too much regulation. So actually regulation is very good for big companies 'cause they can follow it. I can't follow it, right? If I wanna start an AI startup in Europe now, I cannot because there's an AI regulation that makes it very complicated for me. I probably need to get like notaries involved. I need to get certificates licenses. Whereas in America, I can just open my laptop. I can start a AI startup right now, mostly. - What do you think about e/acc, effective accelerationist movement? - Man, you had Beff Jezos on, I love Beff Jezos and he's amazing. And I think e/acc is very needed to similarly create a more positive outlook on the future. Because people have been very pessimistic about society, about the future of society, climate change, all this stuff. E/acc is a positive outlook in the future. It's like technology can make us, we need to spend more energy. We should find ways to of course get like clean energy. But we need to spend more energy to make cooler stuff and go into space, and build more technology that can improve society. And we shouldn't shy away from technology. Technology can be the answer for many things. - Yeah, build more. Don't spend so much time- - Yeah. - On fearmongering and cautiousness and all this kind of stuff. Something is okay, something is good, but most of the time should be spent on building and creating on- - Yeah. - And doing so unapologetically. It's a refreshing reminder of what made United States great is all the builders, like you said, the entrepreneurs. - [Pieter] Yeah. - We can't forget that in all the sort of discussions of how things could go wrong with technology and all this kind of stuff. - Yeah, it goes Kaluga, China. China's now at the stage of like America, what? Like 1900 or something. They're building rapidly insane. And obviously, China's massive problems. But that comes with the whole thing that comes with American is beginning all that massive problems, right? But I think it's very dangerous for a country or a region like Europe to, you get to this point where you're kind of complacent and you're kind of comfortable and then you can either go this or you can go this way, right? You're from here, you go like this, and then you can go this or this. I think you should go this way. - (laughs) And go off. - Yeah, go off. I think it's the problem is the mind culture. So eacc, I made EU Acc, which is like the European kind of version. (Lex laughs) I made like hoodies and stuff. So a lot of people wear like, this make Europe great again hat. - Yeah. - I made it red first, but it became too like Trump. So now it's more like European blue. Make Europe great again. - All right. Okay, so you had incredible life. Very successful, built a lot of cool stuff. So what advice would you give to young people about how to do the same? - Man, I would listen to like nobody. Just do what you think is good and follow your heart, right? Everybody peer press you into doing stuff you don't wanna do. And they tell you, parents or family or society tell you, but try your own thing, 'cause it might work out. You can steer the ship. It probably doesn't work out immediately. You probably go into very bad times like I did as well, relatively, right? But in the end, if you're smart about it, you can make things work and you can create your own little life of things as you did, as I did. And I think that should be more promoted. Do your own thing. There's space in economy and in society for do your own thing. - Yeah. - It's like little villages, everybody would sell. I would sell bread, you would sell meat. Everybody can do their own little thing. You don't need to be a normie as you say. You can be what you really wanna be. - And go all out doing that thing. - Yeah, you gotta go all out 'cause if you half ass it, you cannot succeed. You need to go lean in to the outcast stuff. Lean in to the being different, and just doing whatever it is that you wanna do, right? - You got a whole asset. - Yeah, whole assets, yeah. - This was an incredible conversation. It was an honor to finally meet you. Finally. - It was an honor to be here, Lex. - To talk to you and keep doing your thing. Keep inspiring me and the world with all the cool stuff you're building. - Thank you, man. - Thanks for listening to this conversation with Pieter Levels. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from Drew Houston, Dropbox Co-founder, by the way, I love Dropbox. Anyway, Drew said, "Don't worry about failure. You only have to be right once." Thank you for listening, and I hope to see you next time.`

		transcript: `- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. (energetic music) I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today's podcast episode is all about sleep, and we're also going to talk about the mirror image of sleep, which is wakefulness. Now, these two phases of our life, sleep and wakefulness, govern everything about our mental and physical health, and we're not just gonna talk about what's useful about sleep, we're also gonna talk about how to get better at sleeping, and that will include how to get better at falling asleep, timing your sleep, and accessing better sleep quality. In doing so, we're also gonna discuss how to get more focused and alert in wakefulness, so because sleep and wakefulness are related, we really can't have a conversation about one without the other. Now, in keeping with this theme, you may catch a few snores in the background. Unlike me, my bulldog, Costello, can fall asleep anywhere, anytime, and he happens to be sleeping over there in the corner, so if you hear snoring, that's what that's about. As always, I wanna just mention that this podcast is part of my effort to bring zero-cost-to-consumer public education about science and science-related tools, it is unrelated to my teaching and research roles at Stanford School of Medicine. Today's podcast is brought to us by Helix mattresses, having the proper sleep environment, both the environment you're sleeping in and the object you're sleeping on, is critically important to getting a good night's sleep. Helix mattresses are a little different than most because they're matched to your specific sleep needs, as well as whether or not you tend to run hot or cold as you sleep through the night, what position you sleep in, and so forth, so if you go to their website, they have a quiz that you can take that matches you to the particular mattress that's gonna be best for your sleep needs. I've always had a lot of trouble sleeping, I'm one of these people that can fall asleep easily, but then I wake up and I have a hard time getting back to sleep, and once I switched to a Helix mattress that was precisely matched to my sleep needs, I found I could sleep through the night, which has made a tremendous difference for me. If you wanna try Helix mattresses, you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman, and that will give you up to $200 off on a mattress order, as well as two pillows free with your mattress order, and of course, having the proper pillows is just as important as having the proper mattress. Today's podcast is also brought to us by Headspace, Headspace is a meditation app that teaches you how to meditate. It's fair to say that now there's a ton of research out there in peer-reviewed journals supporting the fact that mindfulness meditation can support mental and physical health, but many people find it hard to meditate, in fact, I'm one of these people. I started meditating in my teens, but then I would drop it every few weeks or so and then I'd get back to it maybe the following week or every year, I just was not very regular about my meditation practice, and then a few years ago I was flying a lot for work and I was on JetBlue flights, and they have Headspace as part of the choice of things that you can watch on the TV screen, and as I started meditating more regularly, what I found is my sleep was better, I would arrive feeling more rested, it was just a tremendous effects on my work performance and other aspects of my life. If you wanna try Headspace, you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer, if you do that, you'll get one month of all of Headspace's meditations for free, that's the best offer right now, so if interested, go to headspace.com/specialoffer. So let's talk about sleep, sleep is this incredible period of our lives where we are not conscious. We might dream, we might twitch, we might even wake up, but in sleep, we are only in relation to things that are happening within our brain and body. Outside sensory experience, in most cases, can't really impact us, and yet, sleep is this tremendously important period of life because it resets our ability to be focused, alert, and emotionally stable in the wakeful period, so we can't really talk about wakefulness, focus, motivation, mood, wellbeing without thinking about sleep, and that's why we're devoting this entire month to the discussion about sleep. Now, we also can't talk about sleep and think about sleep without thinking about wakefulness because it turns out that the period that we call sleep and the period we call wakefulness are tethered to one another. What we do in the waking state determines when we fall asleep, how quickly we fall asleep, whether or not we stay asleep, and how we feel when we wake up the next day, and today, we're going to talk mostly about how to get better at sleeping, and the reason for starting the conversation that way as opposed to just diving into a lot of biology about sleep, is because first of all, there's a lot of information out there already about the biology of sleep. We're gonna touch on a little bit of this, things like stages of sleep and sleep spindles, melatonin, and dreaming, but I think that by now, most people are aware that getting a really good night's sleep on a consistent basis is critically important, but most people don't know how to do that. In fact, I'm guessing that very few of you out there are consistently getting seven to nine hours of really terrific sleep, waking up feeling rested and like you're ready to attack the day, and being able to go through the day feeling focused and alert without dips in energy or focus, so if you're like most people, which includes me, you have some challenges with sleep at least every third or fifth night or so and maybe even more often, so we're really gonna go tool-heavy today and talk about tools that can help you fall asleep, sleep better, and emerge from sleep feeling more rested, and we're gonna do that by grounding our discussion of tools in peer-reviewed studies, mostly from the last 10 years, although some even more recent than that, and we're gonna start by discussing what is sleep and what governs the timing of the onset of sleep, in other words, what makes you get sleepy at a particular time of day. So what determines how well we sleep and the quality of our wakeful state? Turns out that's governed by two forces, the first force is a chemical force, it's called adenosine. Adenosine is a molecule in our nervous system and body that builds up the longer we are awake, so if you've just slept for 8, or 9, or 10 really deep, restful hours, adenosine is gonna be very low in your brain and body. If, however, you've been awake for 10, 15, or more hours, adenosine levels are going to be much higher. Adenosine creates a sort of sleep drive or a sleep hunger, and actually, hunger is the appropriate word here because for most of what we're gonna discuss today, we can think of it in an analogous way to nutrition. Your nutrition and how well you feel after you eat certain foods, your overall level of fitness and your cellular health and your heart health isn't governed by any one food item that you might eat or not eat, it's governed by a number of different factors, how often you eat, how much you eat, which items you eat, et cetera, and what works best for you. In the same way, your sleep and your wakefulness are the product of kind of the average of a number of different behaviors, how long you've been awake is a key one because of this molecule, adenosine. So the reason you get sleepy when you've been up for a while is because adenosine is creeping up steadily the longer you've been awake, and a good way to remember this and think about adenosine is to think about caffeine. Caffeine, for most people, except a very small percentage of people, wakes them up, it makes them feel more alert, in fact, some people are so sensitive to caffeine that they feel jittery if they drink it even in small amounts, other people can drink large amounts of caffeine and not feel jittery at all. Caffeine acts as an adenosine antagonist, what that means is that when you ingest caffeine, whether or not it's coffee or soda or tea, or in any other form, it binds to the adenosine receptor, it sort of parks there just like a car would park in a given parking slot, and therefore, adenosine can't park in that slot. Now, when caffeine parks in the adenosine receptor slot, nothing really happens downstream of that receptor, the receptor can't engage the normal cellular functions of making that cell and you feel sleepy. So the reason caffeine wakes you up is because it blocks the sleepiness receptor, it blocks the sleepy signal, and this is why when that caffeine wears off, adenosine will bind to that receptor, sometimes with even greater, what we call affinity, and you feel the crash, you feel especially tired. Now, I'm not here to demonize caffeine, I love caffeine, and I drink it in the morning and I drink it in the afternoon, but I'm one of these people that, either because of my tolerance or because of some genetic variations that exist among people in terms of their adenosine receptors, I can drink caffeine as late as 4:00 or 5:00 p.m. in the evening and still fall asleep just fine. Some people can't have any caffeine at all or can't have any caffeine past 11:00 a.m. or else their sleep is totally disrupted. All of this has to do with the relationship between adenosine and these adenosine receptors, genetic variation, things that are very hard to find out except experimentally, meaning each of you needs to decide and figure out for yourselves whether or not you can tolerate caffeine and at what times of day you can tolerate caffeine in order to still fall asleep easily and get good sleep, so rather than demonize caffeine, or say that everyone can drink caffeine until late, you need to figure out what's right for you. Caffeine has a lot of health benefits, it also, for some people, can be problematic for health, it can raise blood pressure, et cetera, caffeine increases this molecule that's a neuromodulator that we call dopamine, we discussed this in episode one, which tends to make us feel good, motivated, and give us energy because, as you may have learned in episode one, dopamine is related to another neuromodulator called epinephrine, which gives us energy, in fact, epinephrine is made from dopamine. So let's just take a step back and think about what we're talking about when we're talking about sleepiness, sleepiness is driven by increases in adenosine that happen naturally, caffeine prevents the adenosine from having its action of making us sleepy by blocking that receptor, so it gives us energy and it increases our dopamine levels, but some people can't tolerate caffeine very well, other people can tolerate it just fine, so you need to determine that experimentally. All the data say there's tremendous variation, and right now, the only way that I'm aware of for you to decide whether or not caffeine is a good or a bad thing for you, and whether or not you should ingest it at a given time of day or at all is really to figure that out on your own, in fact, there's a small subset of people that can drink caffeine until very late and they have no trouble falling asleep because they actually have a mutant form of the adenosine receptor, so in keeping with the theme of science and science-related tools, this is one of those cases where I can't give you a one-size-fits-all prescription except to say you need to experiment with caffeine in a way that's safe for you and explore that and figure out what works for you, and then stick with that. Okay, so adenosine is driving this sleep hunger, when adenosine is low, it's like we're well-fed, we're not very hungry, and when adenosine is high, it's like we're fasted for a long time and we tend to be very hungry, so that when adenosine is high, we really wanna fall asleep. If you want, I'm not suggesting you do this experiment, but you can do it, you can stay up for four more hours than you're used to staying up and you'll find that you're very, very sleepy. That's because adenosine is building up at levels higher and higher because you've been awake for those extra four hours. However, if you've ever pulled an all-nighter, you'll notice something interesting, as morning rolls around, you'll suddenly feel an increase in your energy and alertness again, even though adenosine has been building up for the entire night. Now, why is that? The reason that is is because there's a second force which is governing when you sleep and when you're awake, and that force is a so-called circadian force, circadian means about a day or about 24 hours, and inside all of us is a clock that exists in your brain and my brain, and the brain of every animal that we're aware of, that determines when we want to be sleepy and when we want to be awake. Just think about it, we don't go through the day wanting to fall asleep every 30 minutes and then feeling like we're wide awake, our sleep and our period of sleepiness tends to be condensed into one block, typically one 6- to 10-hour block, although there's also variation in terms of how much people want to sleep, and we're going to discuss how you can diagnose your absolute sleep need as well as how to recover sleep that you've lost. That block of sleep and when it falls within each 24-hour cycle is governed by a number of different things, but the most powerful thing that's governing when you want to be asleep and when you want to be awake is light, and in particular, it's governed by sunlight, and I can't emphasize enough how important and how actionable this relationship is between light and when you want to sleep. It's quite simple on the face of it and it's quite simple to resolve, but people tend to make a big mess of this whole circadian literature, frankly, so let's just break it down from the standpoint of what's going on in your brain and body as you go through one 24-hour day. Let's start with waking, so regardless of how well you slept at night or whether or not you were up all night, most people tend to wake up sometime around when the sun rises, maybe not right at sunrise, but within an hour or two or maybe three of sunrise. Now, I realize there are night-shift workers and there are people traveling and experiencing jet lag where this is not going to be the case, we are gonna deal with jet lag and shift work at the end of this podcast, but for most people, we tend to wake up about the time that the sun is rising or so, and as we do that, adenosine levels tend to be low if we've been asleep for reasons that you now understand, and our system generates an internal signal that is in the form of a hormone. Now, I've talked a lot about neuromodulators and neurotransmitters, I haven't talked a lot about hormones yet on this podcast. The definition of a hormone is it's a substance, a chemical that's released from one organ in your body that goes and acts on other organs elsewhere in your body, including your nervous system. When you wake up in the morning, you wake up because a particular hormone called cortisol is released from your adrenal glands, your adrenal glands sit right above your kidneys, and there's a little pulse of cortisol. There's also a pulse of some, and when I say a pulse, I just mean the release of a little bit, there's also a pulse of epinephrine, which is adrenaline, from your adrenals and also in your brain, and you feel awake. Now, that pulse of cortisol and adrenaline and epinephrine might come from your alarm clock, it might come from you naturally waking up, but it tends to alert your whole system in your body that it's time to increase your heart rate, it's time to start tensing your muscles, it's time to start moving about. It's very important that that cortisol pulse come early in the day, or at least, early in your period of wakefulness, I say that because some people are waking up at 8:00 p.m. and are sleeping all day, but it's very important that that pulse of cortisol occur early in the day and that it happens all at once, it sort of sets a rising tide of cortisol in your system. Now, many of you have probably heard about cortisol in relation to stress, and indeed, as we go through our day and our life, different stressors, different events happen in our life that make us feel more alert. Some of the more stressful ones might be looking at your credit card bill and seeing what seems to be a fraudulent charge, or looking at your phone and suddenly seeing a text that something you thought was gonna happen at a particular time is not gonna happen, or you're running late, those will tend to increase norepinephrine and epinephrine and adrenaline in your system, and if they're severe enough, you'll start getting some pulses of cortisol released from your adrenals throughout the day, but there's this normal, healthy rising tide of cortisol that happens early in the day, and I say healthy because it wakes you up, it makes you feel alert, and it makes you feel able to move and wanting to move and to go about your day for work, for exercise, for school, for social relations, et cetera. So when you wake up in the morning is when that cortisol pulse takes off, and something else important happens, a timer is set in your body and in your nervous system that dictates when a different hormone called melatonin, which makes you sleepy, will be secreted from a particular brain region, so let's talk about that. When you wake up in the morning and you experience that rise in cortisol, there's a timer that starts going, and these are cellular timers and they're dictated by the relation between different organs in your body, that says to your brain and body that in about 12 to 14 hours, a different hormone, this hormone we're calling melatonin, will be released from your pineal gland. So there's two mechanisms here, a wakefulness signal and a sleepiness signal, and the wakefulness signal triggers the onset of the timer for the sleepiness signal. Now, that sleepiness signal that we call melatonin that's released from the pineal comes only from the pineal. Unless you're taking exogenous melatonin, you're supplementing with melatonin, the only source of melatonin in your body is going to be this pineal gland, so let's talk about the pineal gland for a second. The pineal gland is a gland that sits kind of in the little structure near, for the aficionados out there, it's kind of near the fourth ventricle, it's about the size of a pea, Descartes, the philosopher, said that the pineal was the seat of the soul, he said that because it's one of the few structures in the human brain that there's only one of them, you know, most structures, there's one on either side of the brain, so-called bihemispheric, but the pineal, there's only one. I don't know anything about souls, really, certainly not the science of souls, but I think it's very unlikely that the pineal is the seat of the soul, but it is a very interesting organ because it's the only organ in our body that releases melatonin, and that melatonin makes us sleepy and lets us fall asleep. Now, I'm guessing that many of you are probably asking, "Should I take melatonin?" My personal bias on this is, except in rare cases, no, for the following reason, melatonin has a second function, which is that melatonin also suppresses the onset of puberty. In kids, and especially in babies, melatonin isn't just released in the evening 12 to 16 hours after we wake, melatonin is released chronically, or tonically, throughout the day and night, and that chronic or tonic release of melatonin is known to suppress some of the other hormones in other regions of the brain that trigger the onset of puberty. Now, if you or your child has been taking melatonin, don't freak out, as always, any kind of supplement or anything that you're going to take or think about taking, you really need to consult with your doctor, I've said this many times on this podcast and it's in the show notes, et cetera, but before you remove anything or add anything to what you're already doing, please do consult with a healthcare professional. However, melatonin is known to suppress the onset of puberty, so much so that regular, cyclic, cycled periods of melatonin release from the pineal really correlate with the onset of puberty and early adulthood, meaning as we start secreting melatonin only at night, that's also when we tend to transition out of puberty. Now, there are a lot of things that correlate in our nervous system, so that doesn't necessarily mean it controls it, but in this case we know, based on lots of data, endocrinology and so forth, that melatonin suppresses the onset of puberty, so supplementing melatonin could be problematic for that reason, but if you've already gone through puberty, it could also have some impact on other hormone systems in your body, so that's why I personally don't like to use melatonin to fall asleep. There's another reason, which is that melatonin will help you fall asleep but it won't help you stay asleep, and many people who take melatonin find that they wake up three to five hours later unable to fall back asleep. Part of the reason for that might be that melatonin purchased at, you can buy it over the counter in most areas of the world even though it's a hormone, which is a little unusual, you can't just go into a pharmacy, at least in the US, and buy testosterone or cortisol or estrogen, you need a prescription, but you can go buy melatonin for whatever reason, I don't know the reasons for that legality, but it's been shown many times, and now I'm borrowing from some items that were in Matt Walker's book, "Why We Sleep," where he stated there is evidence that, in commercially available melatonin, the amount of melatonin has been tested for various brands, it can range anywhere from being 15% of what's listed on the bottle, okay, so if they list this as 100 milligrams, it would be a tremendously high dose, it turns out it's only 15 milligrams in that particular pill or capsule, or up to 400 times more than what's listed on the bottle, so it's completely unregulated, and so for those of you taking melatonin, I will discuss at the end of the podcast some other potential alternatives that are probably safer and don't have these issues. So should you take melatonin? My personal bias is no, but for many people, they find that it does help them, and so if you do find it helps you, then just consider what I'm saying in light of the other practices that you're doing and talk to your healthcare professional. Okay, so the rhythm of cortisol and melatonin is what we call endogenous, it's happening in us all the time without any external input, in fact, if we were in complete darkness, living in a cave with no artificial lights whatsoever, or we were in complete brightness where we never experienced any darkness, these rhythms of cortisol and melatonin would continue, you would have a bump in cortisol, or a pulse in cortisol, that would drop off with time, and then melatonin would come up about 12 to 14 hours later, but these endogenous systems of our body, which are both hormonal and neural, were set so that external things could govern when they happen. Now, this takes us back to episode one of the podcast that if you haven't listened to already, you might wanna listen to, where we talked about sensation and perception and all that, I'm not gonna review it again here, but there's one particular sensory event, one particular influence on your nervous system that determines when that cortisol is going to start to rise, so if you were in complete darkness, it would happen once per 24-hour cycle, but it would be somewhat later and later each day, whereas under normal circumstances, what happens is you wake up, and what happens when you wake up? You open your eyes. When your open your eyes, light comes into your eyes. Now, the way this system works is that you have a particular set of neurons in your eye, they're called retinal ganglion cells, you don't have to remember that if you don't want to, but these retinal ganglion cells are brain neurons, again, the retina is just the one piece of your brain, actually, two pieces because most of you have two retinas, that resides outside the skull, per se. When light comes into the eye, there's a particular group of retinal ganglion cells, or type of retinal ganglion cells, that perceives a particular type of light and communicates that to this clock that resides right above the roof of your mouth called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, okay? So I know this can get a little complicated, but these retinal ganglion cells, when you open your eyes, light comes in, and an electrical signal is sent to this central clock we call the suprachiasmatic nucleus, and the suprachiasmatic nucleus has connections with essentially every cell and organ of your body. Now, it's vitally important that we get light communicated to this central clock in order to time the cortisol and melatonin properly, and when I say properly, I can say that with confidence because we know based on a lot of evidence that if you don't get your cortisol and melatonin rhythms right, there are tremendously broad and bad effects on cardiovascular health, dementia, metabolic effects, learning, depression, dementia, in fact, there're so many negative effects associated with getting this wrong that I don't wanna get into it in too much detail, in fact, I feel like we've been bombarded with all this information about how we're not sleeping well, we're not sleeping at the right times, we're not sleeping enough, to the point where people now have sleep anxiety, if they can't sleep well for a night, they're feeling overwhelmed by that and it's sort of now they're stressed about not being able to sleep which is making it harder to sleep, et cetera. I really wanna focus on what we can do to anchor these systems properly, so let's think about what happens when we do this correctly and how to do it correctly. When we wake up, our eyes open, now, if we're in a dark room, there isn't enough light to trigger the correct timing of this cortisol-melatonin thing, these rhythms. You might say, "Well, why won't any light do it?" Well, it turns out that these neurons in our eye that set the circadian clock and then allow our circadian clock to set all the clocks of all the cells and organs and tissues of our body responds best to a particular quality of light and amount of light, and those are the qualities of light and amount of light that come from sunlight, so these neurons, what they're really looking for, although they don't have a mind of their own, is the sun at what we call low solar angle, the eye and the nervous system don't know anything about sunrises or sunsets, it only knows the quality of light that comes in when the sun is low in the sky, the system evolved so that when the sun is low in the sky, there's a particular contrast between yellows and blues that triggers the activation of these cells, so if you wake up and you look at your phone or your computer, or you flip on a bunch of artificial lights, will these cells be activated? And the answer is, sort of, they'll be activated but not in the optimal way. What you want to do is get sunlight in your eyes as close to waking as possible. Now, I wanna be really clear about this because I've talked about it on other podcasts when I was a guest and I talked about it on my Instagram feed, and there seemed to be the same questions coming up again and again, these neurons don't know sunlight, per se, they don't know sunrise or sunset, for that matter, they don't know artificial light from sunlight, what they respond best to, however, is the quality and amount of light that comes in when the sun is low in the sky, that means that if you can watch the sunrise, great, that's perfect for triggering activation of these cells, however, if you wake up a few hours after the sunrise, which I tend to most days, personally, you still wanna get outside and view sunlight, you don't need the sunlight beaming you directly in the eyes, there's a lot of photons, light energy, that's scattered from sunlight at this time, but the key is to get that light energy, from sunlight, ideally, into your eyes. Now, I know many of you are already asking, "Well, I live in Scandinavia," or, "I can't get sunlight, "there's buildings around me," et cetera, we will get to all of that, but it's critically important that you get outside to get this light. I had a discussion with a colleague of mine, Dr. Jamie Zeitzer, who's in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Stanford, a world expert in this, and he tells me that it's 50 times less effective to view this sunlight through a window, through a car windshield, or through the side window of a car than it is to just get outside with no sunglasses and view light early in the day. Now, if you can't see the sunrise, like I said, you can see this within an hour or two of sunrise, but it has to be low solar angle, once the sun is overhead, the quality of light shifts so that you miss this opportunity to time the cortisol pulse, and that turns out to be a bad thing to do, you really wanna time that cortisol pulse properly because, we'll get into this a little bit more later, but a late-shifted cortisol pulse, in particular, a 9:00 p.m. or 8:00 p.m. increase in cortisol is one of the consequences, and maybe one of the causes, of a lot of anxiety disorders and depression, so it's kind of a chicken-egg thing, we don't know whether or not it's correlated with, it's the cause, or the effect, but it's a signature of depression and anxiety disorder. Bringing that cortisol pulse earlier in your wakeful period, earlier in your day, has positive benefits ranging from blood pressure to mental health, et cetera, not gonna list them all off because there's just so many of them, but many, many positive things happen when you are getting the cortisol early in the day far away from your melatonin pulse. Okay, so how long should you be outside? Well, this is gonna vary tremendously because some people live in environments where it's very bright, so let's say it's Colorado in the middle of winter, there's a snowfield, there's no cloud cover, and you walk outside, there's going to be so much photon light energy arriving on your retina that it probably only takes 30 to 60 seconds to trigger the central clock and set your cortisol and melatonin rhythms properly and get everything lined up nicely, whereas if you're in Scandinavia in the depths of winter and you wake up at 5:00 a.m. and the sun is just barely creeping across the horizon and then goes back down again a few hours later, you probably are not getting enough sunlight in order to set these rhythms, so many people find that they need to use sunlight simulators in the form of particular lights that were designed to simulate sunlight, however, and I'm not out to attack the companies that produce those, there's another solution to that, you can simply go outside for longer, even if there's a lot of dense cloud cover, you're probably getting anywhere from 10,000 to 50,000 lux, L-U-X, which is just a measure of light energy, and that should be sufficient to set the circadian clock. You could say, "Well, the lights in my house or my phone "are really, really bright, right? "Everyone's telling us to stay off our phones at night "because they're really bright," but guess what, it turns out that early in the day, your retina is not very sensitive, which means you need a lot of photons, ideally coming from sunlight, to set these clock mechanisms, so looking at your phone or artificial lights is fine if you wake up before sunrise, but it's not going to work to set these clock mechanisms, and this is supported by dozens, if not hundreds, of quality peer-reviewed studies, so you wanna use sunlight, if you can't see sunlight because of your environment, then you are going to have to opt for artificial light, and in that case, you're going to want an artificial light that either simulates sunlight or has a lot of blue light. Now, without going off course here, you might be saying, "Wait, I've heard blue light is bad for me." Actually, blue light is great for this mechanism during the day, we can talk about blue light and blue blockers, but you really want a lot of blue and yellow light arriving on the retina early in the day. Let me be clear about something, you never ever want to look at any light, sunlight or artificial light, that is painful to look at. If you find that your eyes are watering or you're having challenges maintaining, you know, looking at this thing for a while because it's painful, that light is too bright and you do not wanna damage your retina, so you don't wanna gaze at the sun refusing to blink and burn your retina, that's actually possible to do, you don't wanna do that. You have a proper blink reflex installed in you since birth, and if you feel like something's too bright and you need to blink, it means you need to blink, that it's too much light, so please don't beam your eyes with really bright light, but blue light, in particular, blue light and yellow light coming from sunlight is ideal, if you're going to get it from artificial light because you can't get enough sunlight, well, then, artificial lights that are rich in blue, blue wavelengths, are going to be ideal for setting this mechanism. A lot of people will say, "Oh, I should be "wearing blue blockers throughout the day." No, that's the exact wrong thing, if you're going to use blue blockers, we can talk about that, that should be reserved for late in the evening because light suppresses melatonin. I've been asked many times before about this pineal gland and there are a lot of ancient practices that map to some of the things that I'm saying, and people will always say, "Oh, I heard that sunlight "is great for the pineal." Well, perhaps, but we have to careful about that phrase, sunlight inhibits the pineal, it prevents it from releasing melatonin, darkness allows the pineal to release melatonin, so the pineal is not the gland or the organ of sunlight, it is the gland of darkness, in fact, melatonin can be thought of as a sleepiness signal that's correlated with darkness, so get up each morning, try and get outside, I know that can be challenging for people, but anywhere from 2 to 10 minutes of sunlight exposure is going to work well for most people, and you wanna do this on a regular basis and you don't have to do it exactly at sunrise, I realize I'm repeating myself, but somehow, despite barking at people about this for a couple years now, I keep getting the same questions, and somehow, it hasn't been sinking in, which could be related to some circadian disorder, I'm just kidding, if it's not sinking in, it's probably that I'm not being effective in communicating the information, but get that bright light early in the day from sunlight, and if you can't get it from sunlight, get it from artificial light. What kinds of artificial lights will work? Well, there are these sunrise simulators, but the ring lights that people use for selfies and this sort of thing, for posting on Instagram, those generate a lot of blue light. If wanna get experimental about this, there's a free app, I have no relationship to the app, but it's a great app called Light Meter that you can use your phone and you can measure the amount of photon energy in your environment, and it's kind of a fun experiment to do, you can go outside in the morning and you'll see that there's 10,000, 20,000 lux, even though it might seem like it's kinda dim or there's tree cover or cloud cover, you go inside and you shine an artificial light at your phone, press the button on Light Meter and you'll find that it's only 500 or 1,000 lux, and you realize that even though it seems really bright, the artificial light is very condensed, whereas the outside light is scattered in the atmosphere, and so you can think that you're not getting much sunlight but you're actually getting much more outside, so get outside, get that sunlight early in the day, and try and do it on a consistent basis. If you can't do it every day or you sleep through this period of the early day, low solar angle, don't worry about it, these systems in the body, these hormone systems and neurotransmitter systems that make you awake at certain periods of the day and sleepy at other times are operating by averaging when you view the brightest light. Now, that can immediately tell us that what most people are doing is terrible, they're waking up and they're looking at their phone, which isn't triggering activation of these cells in the eye and the central circadian clock, then a few hours later, they might get in their car with sunglasses and drive. Now, a note about sunglasses and prescription lenses, absolutely never, ever, ever compromise safety for the sorts of things I'm talking about, so if you need to wear sunglasses for safety reasons, wear them, absolutely, if you wear prescription lenses or contacts, wear them, they won't filter out the wavelengths of light that are necessary for setting these central clocks, so safety first, of course, if you have a retinal degenerative disorder, retinitis pigmentosa, macular degeneration, or glaucoma, or those run in your family, you want to avoid excessively bright light all the time, you wanna be very cautious about that, you're going to wanna get your light exposure through seeing dimmer light, including sunlight, but for longer periods of time, perhaps. You might immediately ask, "What about low-vision or blind people, "how do they set these central clocks?" Well, turns out that low-vision and blind people, most of them, provided they still have eyes, that the eyes weren't removed because of a burn or a tumor or something like that, still maintain these neurons that set the circadian clock, which brings me to a really important point, it's not about seeing and perceiving the sun, this is a subconscious mechanism by which these neurons, which are called melanopsin ganglion cells, these neurons set your central clocks by getting activated by the particular wavelengths of light that are present in the atmosphere, even coming through cloud cover, and you don't need to see or perceive the sun in order to get this mechanism to start. Now, it's such a vitally important mechanism because it dictates how well and what time you will want to fall asleep later in the day, so for those of you that are night owls and you insist that you're a night owl and you have the genetic polymorphism that makes you a night owl, you may very well have that genetic polymorphism, those genes that make you want to stay up late and wake up late, but chances are, about half of you that think that you're night owls are just not getting enough sunlight early in the day. So viewing light early in the day, ideally sunlight, is key for establishing healthy sleep-wake rhythms and for allowing you to fall asleep easily at night. Now, it's not gonna make sure that all that happens every single time, but it is the foundation of proper sleep and what we call circadian health, it governs metabolism and so many other things that are supposed to exist on a regular 24-hour cycle. Some of you, many of you, might be asking, "What else can help set this rhythm?" Well, it turns out that light is what we call the primary zeitgeber, the time giver, but other things can help establish this rhythm of cortisol followed by melatonin 12 to 16 hours later as well. The other things besides light are timing of food intake, timing of exercise, as well as various drugs or chemicals that one might ingest, not illegal drugs, although those will impact circadian mechanisms as well, but the reason we focus so heavily on light is that light is the main way that this central clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, was supposed to be set, and we know that because it's the only direct input to the clock. These neurons in the eye that are also part of the brain that we call melanopsin ganglion cells that, not so incidentally, were discovered by my friend and colleague David Berson at Brown University, and others, Samer Hattar, King-Wai Yau, et cetera, worked out the mechanisms, the molecular mechanisms, but it was really David Berson that discovered these incredibly fascinating, you know, these are cells that aren't important for sight like pattern vision, but are for setting our clocks, David's really credited with making that discovery. Those cells are the main way and the only direct way to set the clock, in fact, it's fair to say that light viewed by these melanopsin cells, in particular, sunlight, is 1,000 to 10,000 times more effective than, say, getting up in darkness and just exercising. That doesn't mean that you shouldn't exercise early in the day in darkness if that's what you like to do, it will have somewhat an effect on raising your wakefulness early in the day and setting these rhythms, and this is because of some other pathways, for the aficionados out there who wanna know more neuroscience, here's how it goes, you've got this clock above the roof of your mouth that churns out this 24-hour rhythm and it's communicated to all the other organs and tissues of your body, but there's another structure, it has a cool name, it's called the intergeniculate leaflet, which sits a few millimeters away in the brain, and it's involved in regulating the clock output through what's called non-photic, non-light-type influences like exercise and feeding, et cetera. So if you are not feeling awake during the day and you're having trouble sleeping, get the sunlight exposure that we just talked about, but in addition to that, if you wanna become an early riser, for instance, and you wanna feel more awake during the early part of the day, by getting that light exposure and exercising early in the day, you will, after two or three days, you will naturally start to wake up earlier in the day, and that's because these clock mechanisms have shifted, it's like setting the clock earlier as opposed to delaying the clock, and that takes us to a somewhat complicated, but very important, aspect to all this, which is, what sets the clock and keeps it anchored? The main thing is that bright light early in the day, the other thing is sunset, when the sun is also at low solar angle, low, close to the horizon, by viewing sunlight at that time of day in the evening, or afternoon, depending on what time of year it is and where you are in the world, these melanopsin cells, these neurons in your eye, signal the central circadian clock that it's the end of the day, and there's a really nice study that was published last year, and I will put links to these references on a website not too long from now, there was a really nice study that showed that viewing sunlight around the time of the sunset, doesn't have to be just crossing the horizon, but circa sunset, within an hour or so of sunset, prevents some of the bad effects of light in preventing melatonin release later that same night, so let me repeat this, viewing light early in the day is key, viewing light later in the day when the sun is setting, or around that time, can help protect these mechanisms, your brain and body, against the negative effects of light later in the day, so let me talk about you would do that, you'd go view the sunset or you would go outside in the late afternoon or evening, again, if you safely can do that with sunglasses off, you will, if you need to wear sunglasses, fine, but it will take probably 100 to 1,000 times longer with dark sunglasses than if you take them off, again, if you wanna do this through a window at work, that's fine, but it'll take 50 times longer, so the best thing to do is just to get outside for a few minutes, anywhere from 2 to 10 minutes, also in the afternoon. Having those two signals arriving to your central clock that your body, your internal world, knows when it's morning and knows when it's evening, is tremendously powerful. Maybe think about it this way, every cell in your body needs glucose and energy, it needs, whether or not it gets that from meats or it gets it from ketones or it gets it from carbohydrates or fruit or vegetables, it doesn't matter, it is eventually converted into a certain form of energy that all your cells use, but you don't take glucose, you don't take bread or a steak or a nice orange and shove it in your ear, you put it in your mouth, it goes into your stomach, it's digested, and then that resource is distributed to all the cells of your body. Every cell in your body needs oxygen, and you don't put a hose you know, through your nostril or through your ear or through some other orifice in your body, you inhale air and it's then distributed via the lungs to the cells in your blood stream, and then it's distributed to all the organs of your body. Every cell and organ in your body needs light information, and the way to get that light information to all those cells, because you have a thick skull and the inside of you is dark inside your skin, there's no sunlight getting in there, is by viewing sunlight with your eyes at the two times of day that I'm referring to, okay? That's the only route. There was a study published in "Science," an excellent journal, well over 10 years ago, that showed that light shone on the back of the knee could set these circadian rhythms, that study was retracted, and unfortunately, most people don't know that it was retracted, there were some experimental flaws, that people were actually viewing light through their eyes. That study was repeated, turns out, there is no extraocular photo reception in humans. Whatever somebody tells you that light to the skin or light to the wherever is beneficial for your health, we can talk about that, but there's no way that light information is setting your clocks, you need these cells in your eyes to perceive or to see light at the particular times of day that I'm referring to. Some animals, like snakes and other reptiles, actually have a hole in the top of their skull to get light information directly to their pineal to suppress melatonin. We don't have that hole, I mean, most of you don't have holes in your skull. These holes in your skull that we call the sockets for the eyes are actually there primarily to allow light information to this central clock, and then vision and pattern vision and color vision came much later in evolution, we know this on the basis of genetic studies we get to discuss in a future podcast. So get that light information to the cells of your brain and body by viewing sunlight at the two times of day that I referred to. There's always a lot of questions about, "How long, how much, how do I know if I've had enough?" You'll know because your rhythm will start to fall into some degree of normalcy, you'll start to wake up at more or less the same time each day, you'll fall asleep more easily at night, generally, it takes about two or three days for these systems to align, so if you've not been doing these behaviors, it's gonna take a few days, but they can have tremendous benefits, and sometimes rather quickly, on a number of different mental and physical aspects of your health. Now let's talk about the bad effects of light because light is not supposed to arrive in our system at any time, and nowadays, because of screens and artificial light, we have access to light at times of day and night that normally we wouldn't. Now, earlier I said that you need a lot of light, in particular, sunlight, to set these clock mechanisms, that's true, but there's a kind of diabolical feature to the way all of this works, which is the longer you've been awake, the more sensitive your retina and these cells are to light, so that if you've been awake for 10, 12, 14 hours, it becomes very easy for even a small amount of light coming from a screen or from an overhead light to trigger the activation of the clock and make you feel like you wanna stay up later, make it harder to fall asleep, and disrupt your sleep pattern, okay? So the simple way to think about this is you want as much light as is safely possible early in the day, morning and throughout the day, including blue light, so take those blue blockers off during the day unless you have a real issue with screen light sensitivity, and you want as little light coming into your eyes, artificial or sunlight, after, say, 8:00 p.m., and certainly, you do not want to get bright light exposure to your eyes between 11:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m., and here's why, David Berson, who I mentioned before, and another and friend and colleague, Samer Hattar, who's director of the chronobiology unit at the National Institutes of Mental Health published a paper in "Cell," which is a journal, another excellent journal, very high stringency, showing that light that arrives to the eyes between 11:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m., approximately, suppresses the release of dopamine, this neuromodulator that makes us feel good, and it's sort of an endogenous antidepressant, and can inhibit learning and create all sorts of other detrimental effects, it does this through a mechanism, for those of you that wanna know the neural pathways, that involves light to the eyes that's then signaled to a structure called the habenula, the habenula looks like two little bat ears sitting right in the middle of a structure in your brain called the thalamus, don't worry about these names if you're not interested in this stuff, if you are, these are just avenues to explore, when that habenula gets activated it's actually called the disappointment nucleus because it actually makes us feel less happy and more disappointed, and can lead to certain forms of depression in the wakeful state. Now, if you wake up in the middle of the night and you need to use the bathroom or you're on an all-night flight and you're, you know, need to read or whatever it is, fine, every once in a while, it's not gonna be a problem to get bright light exposure to your eyes in the middle of the night, but if you think about our lifestyle nowadays and being up late looking at phones, even if you dim that screen, you're triggering this activation because your retinal sensitivity and the sensitivity of these neurons has gone up late in the day. Now, I'm not here to dictate what you should or shouldn't do, but for those of you that are experiencing challenges with mood, those of you that have anxiety, learning problems, issues focusing, the questions I usually get are, "How can I focus better?" Well, we will get to that, but one of the best ways you can support your mechanisms for good mood, mental health, learning, focus, metabolism, et cetera, is to take control of this light exposure behavior at night and not get much or any bright light exposure in the middle of the night. Red light won't trigger this pathway, but very few people have the kind of infrared lights that are set up, or floor lights, and that brings me to an important point, which is about the location of light, this hasn't been discussed much out there, I don't think, these cells in our eye, these neurons that signal the central clock, reside mostly, not exclusively, but mostly, in the bottom half of our retina, and because we have a lens in front of our retina, and because of the optics of lenses, that means that these cells are actually viewing our upper visual field, there's an inversion of the visual image, et cetera, you can look that up if you wanna learn more about retinal optics, it's fascinating, but not the topic for today. These cells are in the bottom half of your retina mostly, and so they're viewing the overhead visual space around you. This is probably not coincidental that these cells were essentially designed to detect sunlight, which is overhead, of course, so if you want to avoid improper activation of these neurons, it's better to place lights that you use in the evening low in your physical environment, so on desktops or even the floor, if you wanna go that way, as opposed to overhead lights, so overhead florescent lights would be the worst, that would be the worst case scenario, lights that are overhead that are a little bit softer, of the sort or yellow or reddish tints, would be slightly better, but dim lights that are set low in the room are going to be best because they aren't going to activate these neurons and therefore shift your circadian clock, so that's a goal. Some people, like Samer Hattar that I mentioned earlier, he turns his home basically into a cave in the evenings. Candlelight actually does not trigger activation of these cells, so candlelight and fireplaces and campfires are fine, dim lights, very dim lights are fine, and lights low in the physical environment, of course, the problem with candlelight and fireplaces is the fire hazard, but you're smart people, you know what to do about that. Don't burn down whatever structure you're in, including forests, please. So, keep the lights low in in your environment. What if you wake up in the middle of the night and you find yourself watching TV or on the computer? Well, in that case, you might wanna wear blue blockers, and you certainly would wanna dim the screen, but ideally, you're not doing that, it's remarkable the positive effects of getting that bit of sunlight early in the day, maybe even also around sunset, and avoiding bright lights, and especially overhead bright lights, between about 11:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m.. Now, I'm not talking about shift work, I'm realizing that we're probably gonna have to have an entire discussion devoted just to shift workers because there's some good information there about how they can protect themselves against some of the very bad health effects of shift work, of getting light in the middle of the night, but we rely on shift workers and they're super important to culture and society and the economy, so I wanna acknowledge them and let you know that we will do a discussion about shift work and jet lag, but let's talk about what light can do in terms of shifting us in healthy ways. So the way to think about this whole system, again, is you've got adenosine building up depending on how long you've been awake and it's making you sleepy, and then you've got the circadian mechanisms that are timing your wakefulness and timing when you wanna be asleep, mainly through cortisol and melatonin, but there are a bunch of other things that are downstream of cortisol and melatonin, like, we tend to be hungrier during our wakeful period than late at night, some people like to eat late at night, but if you're finding that you can't become a day person or a morning person, shifting your light exposure, exercise, and food intake to the daytime will help. Some people like to stop eating around 6:00 or 8:00 p.m. because of metabolic reasons or they're trying to maintain their weight or lose weight, that's actually not supported so well by the literature, the literature around nutrition essentially says that it's best to restrict your feeding to a certain period of each 24-hour cycle to not be eating around the clock, and whether or not that's 4 hours or 8 hours or 16 hours is a much lengthier discussion than we have time for now, I would refer you to Satchin Panda's book, "The Circadian Code," which talks all about that, he's an expert, a former colleague of mine from the Salk Institute in San Diego, you can explore intermittent and circadian fasting, so to speak, through Satchin's literature, we'll talk about that, we might even get Satchin in here if we're lucky at some point in the future, but you can actually use light to wake up earlier. Jamie Zeitzer and colleagues did a beautiful study showing that, if you turn on the lights before waking up, so around 45 minutes to an hour before waking up, even if your eyelids are closed, provided you're not under the covers, after doing that for a few days, that increases your total sleep time and shifts forward the time at which you feel sleepy, it makes you want to go to bed earlier each night. Now, in a kind of diabolical way, they did this with teenagers who are notorious for wanting to wake up late and stay up late, and what they found was bright light flashes, just turning on the lights in their environment, overhead lights, because they're trying to activate this system and that's why they're using overhead lights, even through the eyelids, before these kids woke up, then made those kids naturally wanna go to bed earlier and they ended up sleeping longer, so that's something you could try, you could put your lights on a timer to go on early in the day before you wake up, you could open your blinds so that sunlight is coming through, and again, if you curl up under the covers, then it's not gonna reach these neurons, but it's remarkable that light can actually penetrate the eyelids, activate these neurons, and go to the central clock. That study illustrates a really important principle of how you're built, which is, you have the capacity for what are called phase advances and phase delays, and I don't wanna complicate this too much, so the simplest way to think about phase advances and phase delays is that if you see light late in the day, and in particular, in the middle of the night, your brain and body, for reasons that now you understand, will think that that's morning light even though it's not sunlight because you have this heightened sensitivity, and it will phase delay, it will delay your clock, it will essentially make you want to get up later and go to sleep later, so if you get light exposure too late in the evening or in the middle of the night, it's going to make it hard to want to wake up that next morning early and to go to bed early. The opposite is also true, if you wake up early, say, 6:00 a.m. or 7:00 a.m., and get light exposure, or even earlier, 4:00 a.m., and get light exposure, it will phase-advance your clock, okay? It's gonna make your clock think it's earlier and you'll wanna wake up earlier, so the simple way to think about this is if you're having trouble waking up early and feeling alert early in the day, you're going to wanna try and get bright light exposure even before waking up because it will advance your clock, it's sort of like turning the clock forward, whereas if you are having trouble waking up early, you definitely don't want to get too much light exposure or any light exposure to your eyes late in the evening and in the middle of the night because it's just gonna delay your clock more and more, so rather than get into the specifics of everybody's situation because there are many of you out there with different situations and lifestyle requirements, et cetera, the way to think about this is that you have these internal mechanisms of adenosine and circadian clocks, and they're always operating, and what you're trying to do is provide them anchors, you're trying to provide them consistent, powerful anchors so that your cortisol, your melatonin, and then everything that cascades down from that, like your metabolism and your ability to learn and your sense of alertness, your dopamine, your serotonin, all that stuff is timed regularly, one of the reasons why there's so much challenge out there with focus and anxiety and depression, there are a lot of reasons for that, but one of the reasons is that people's internal mechanisms aren't anchored to anything regular. Now, this doesn't require being neurotically attached to getting up at a very specific time, going outside, viewing the sunlight at the same time every day, these systems, again, will average, but if you can provide them consistent light anchors early in the day and in the evening, and avoiding light at night, you will be amazed at the tremendous number of positive effects that can come from that at the level of metabolic factors, hormones, and just general feelings of wellbeing, in fact, most of us are familiar with what it is to not sleep well and all the terrible effects that has, maybe one night you're fine, two nights even, for the new parents out there, I sympathize with you, but most people are not familiar with what it is to sleep really, really well on a consistent basis, and when you start doing that by controlling your sleep environment, right, get the proper sleep surface, get the proper pillow, get the temperature in the room right, get your light exposure right, start timing your exercise at normal periods or times throughout the day and week, it's amazing how many other biological systems just naturally fall in line, and this is why whenever people ask me, "What should I take?" which is one of the most common questions I get, "What supplement should I take? "What drug should I be taking? "What things should I be taking?" The first question I always ask them is, "How's your sleep?" and 90% of the time, they tell me they either have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep or they don't feel rested throughout the day. A brief note about naps, naps, provided that they're less than one ultradian cycle, provided they're 20 minutes or 30 minutes or even an hour, can be very beneficial for a lot of people, you don't have to take them, but many people naturally feel a dip in energy and focus late in the afternoon, in fact, if we were gonna look at wakefulness, what we would find is that you get that morning light exposure, hopefully, your cortisol goes up, people will start feeling awake, and then around two, or three, or four in the afternoon, there's a spike in everything from alertness to ability to learn, some metabolic factors drop, and then it just naturally comes back up, and then it tapers off as the night goes on. So for some of you, naps are great, I love taking naps, some people, they wake up from naps feeling really groggy, that's probably because they're not sleeping as well as they should at night or as long as they should at night, and so they're dropping into REM sleep or deeper forms of sleep in the day time, and then they wake up and they feel kind of disoriented, other people feel great after a nap, so that's another case where, just like with caffeine, so sort of have to evaluate for yourself. As we discuss this, you're probably realizing this is a lot like nutrition where nowadays it's just crazy, I mean, if you go on social media, it's like you've got people who are pushing carnivore, you've got other people who are pushing vegan, other people who are pushing paleo, every variation of every diet, and there's a lot of data to support any and all of those and the arguments go on and on, and there's probably a lot of genetic variation and lifestyle variation that's going to dictate whether or not something is good for you, whether or not you like it, whether or not you'll stick to it. The same thing is true for circadian and sleep and wakefulness behaviors, except the light-viewing behavior that I talked about before, there's no way around that, that's hardwired into our system, the same way we could factually say that everybody needs some nutrition at some level from some source, everybody needs light information arriving in their system in some way at regular intervals, so that's really what this is about. Okay, so naps are gonna be good for some people, not for others, I have a colleague, a very accomplished neuroscientist, who likes to take naps just after lunch, I personally like to take a nap around 3:00 or 4:00 p.m., but there's a practice that I've adopted in the last 5 years that I've found to be immensely beneficial that is sort of like napping but isn't napping, it's a thing that they call yoga nidra, yoga nidra actually means yoga sleep, and it's a sort of meditation that you listen to, there are number of scripts, I've talked about this on podcasts before but I'm going to post a link to the two that I like most, that allows you to consciously bring your entire body and mind into a state of deep relaxation, and sometimes you fall asleep and sometimes you don't, this is done for 10 to 30 or even 60 minutes at a time. The other thing that works really well is meditation, so I'm talking about naps, but I'm also talking about yoga nidra, which is sort of a form of meditation, and then more standard forms of meditation, all three of those do something powerful which is that they bring our mind into a state of less so-called sympathetic nervous system activation, go back and listen to episode one if that doesn't make any sense, which is what governs your alertness, and instead, it activates cells and circuits in your body that promote the parasympathetic nervous system, or the calming system. A lot of people are not good falling asleep because they're not good at calming down, so some people have no trouble falling asleep, but many people have a hard time falling asleep, or at least every once in a while experience challenges falling asleep. I don't have problems falling asleep most nights, but I've noticed that if I'm working very hard or if the world is particularly stressful, my mind gets into a bit of a kind of OCD loop where I tend to ruminate on things, and I'm not even thinking about anything in particular, it's just challenging for me to disengage and fall asleep. Meditation and yoga nidra scripts have been immensely helpful for me in terms of accelerating the transition to sleep, so they involve taking a few minutes, 10 to 30 minutes or so, just like you would for a nap, and just listening to a script, almost passively, and it has you do some particular patterns of breathing and some other kind of body-scan-like things that can really help people learn to relax, not just in that moment, but get better at relaxing and turning off thinking in order to fall asleep when they wanna do that at night. There's another thing that's similar to this, which is certain forms of hypnosis for sleep, for that, I'll just refer you to the website of a colleague and collaborator of mine, David Spiegel, who's our associate chair of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Stanford, he's developed a website, which is reverie, R-E-V-E-R-I-E, health.com, so reveriehealth.com, that has a lot of science-supported, clinically supported hypnosis scripts that essentially take the brain into states of deep relaxation for the sake of rewiring the brain and neuroplasticity, but one of those scripts that's there and is available free is for sleep, and we'll talk more about hypnosis at a later time because it has a ton of other effects that aren't just limited to sleep. So a period of time each day that you devote to getting better at falling and staying asleep is actually a really good practice to adopt. The other thing about these practices like meditation, yoga nidra, and hypnosis, is people would always say to me, "Well, when should I do them?" and I always say, "Well, the best time of day to do it "is when you first wake up in the morning, "provided you've gotten your sunlight already, "anytime you wake up in the middle of the night, "or any time of day." In other words, they're always good for you because it's a training mechanism by which you self-train your nervous system to go from a state of heightened alertness that you don't want to heightened relaxation that you do want, and so it's really teaching you to hit the brake, and that brings us to an even more important point, perhaps, which is, we've all experienced that we can stay up if we want to, right? If we wanna stay up late on New Year's or we wanna push an all-nighter, some people can do that more easily than others, but we're all capable of doing that, but it's very hard to make ourselves fall asleep, and so there's a sort of asymmetry to the way our autonomic nervous system, which governs this alertness-calmness thing, the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system, there's an asymmetry there where we are more easily able to engage wakefulness and drive wakefulness, we can force ourselves to stay awake, than we are able to force ourselves to fall asleep, and one of the things that I say over and over again, and I'm gonna continue to say over and over again, is it's very hard to control the mind with the mind, when you have trouble falling asleep, you need to look to some mechanism that involves the body, and all the things I described, meditation, hypnosis, yoga nidra, all involve exhale-emphasized breathing, certain ways of lying down and controlling the body, we're gonna get into breathing in real depth at another time, but all of those involve using the body to control the mind rather than trying to, you know, wrestle your mind into a certain pattern of relaxation, so earlier in episode one, I talked about the Mobius strip, this continuous loop that is the brain-body relationship, or the mind-body relationship, and when we're having trouble controlling the mind, I encourage people to look towards the body, look toward sunlight, avoid sunlight and bright light if that happens to be late at night, so there's a theme that's starting to emerge which is, in order to control this thing that we call the nervous system, we have to look back to some of the things we discussed earlier, like sensation, perception, et cetera, but we have to ask, what can we control? Well, I'm talking about controlling light exposure, controlling your breathing and body, I'm not going into details right now but you can see the yoga nidra script or the reveriehealth.com, or Headspace would be a great place to adopt a meditation practice, any of those are really teaching you to use your body to control your mind, and to allow you to explore the mind-body relationship in a way that gives you more control over your mind and the mind-body relationship, okay? So we talked about light, we talked about activity and timing of light, we talked about the usefulness of naps, and these things that I'm calling non-sleep deep rest, which include meditation, yoga nidra, and hypnosis, non-sleep deep rest, or what I, hereafter, we will refer to as NSDR, not to be confused with EMDR, I don't think I've ever heard NSDR, so I'm planting a flag for NSDR, non-sleep deep rest, as a way to reset one's ability to be awake after you emerge from NSDR, so to get some more wakefulness and ability to attend, some emotional stability, reset, as well as make it better and easier to fall asleep when you wanna go to sleep at night. Now, the non-sleep deep rest does have some research to support it, there's a beautiful study done out of a university in Denmark, I will later provide a link to that study, that showed that this meditation and yoga nidra-type meditation allows dopamine and other neuromodulators in an area of the brain called the striatum that's involved in motor planning and motor execution, to reset itself, in other words, this NSDR can reset our ability to engage in the world in a way that's very deliberate, and not to throw in another acronym, but NSDR resets your ability to engage in DPOs, duration, path, and outcome, so now you're probably rolling your eyes like, "Oh my goodness, the number of acronyms," but just bear with me because NSDR is so powerful, because first of all, it doesn't require that you rig yourself to any device, it doesn't require that you take much time out of your day, it doesn't require that you ingest anything, except air, and it can have so many positive effects right down to the neuromodulator level, so I think in the years to come, my lab's exploring this in a collaboration with David Spiegel's lab, but other labs are looking at this as well, I think NSDR is going to start to play a more prominent role in what we call wellness and health, both mental health and physical health, so I encourage you to explore those practices. Okay, so what about things that we can and maybe should or should not take in order to control and access better sleep and better wakefulness? We've talked about things you can do or not do, we've talked about nutrition and the timing of nutrition, now let's talk about compounds, those could be prescription drugs, those could be supplements, there are a number of different things that will affect your circadian timing and behavior, in fact, almost everything that you could take will affect your circadian timing and behavior, that's right. So years ago when I was in graduate school, I had a professor, unfortunately, he passed away now, but his name was Ted Jones, the late Edward Jones, who was a world-class neuroanatomist, he wrote the book on the thalamus, in fact, it's called "The Thalamus," and an expert on patterns of activation in the brain during sleep, and I'll never forget that during one of these lectures, someone asked Ted the question, "What is the effect of some drug "on these waves of activity in the thalamus?" or something, and his answer was incredible. Now, he was a pretty gruff guy, and so his answer was delivered in the form of a kind of aggressive direct statement, he said, "A drug is a substance "that when injected into a person, "produces a scientific publication," and what he was saying is actually quite true, which is that most every compound will have some effect on some aspect of biology, this is why it's hard to sort through everything that's on PubMed, if you put any molecule or compound or drug into PubMed and then you put sleep next to it, or alertness next to it, you're likely to find a paper where there's an effect, but that's not necessarily telling you that that drug is helpful for that, what it's telling you is that anytime you change what you take or you stop taking something, say you're taking sleeping pills, Ambien or whatever it is, and you stop taking them, your sleep behavior will change. Let's stay you take an aspirin and you don't normally take aspirin, you will shift your circadian rhythm, now you might not shift it perceptibly, you might not create problems for yourself, but anytime you ingest a compound at high potency, you're going to provide some shift to your circadian rhythm. Now, that said, there are a couple things that are directly in line with the biology related to falling and staying asleep and directly in line with the biology of wakefulness, there's a whole category of things, like stimulants, cocaine, amphetamine, and prescription stimulants, that are, the prescription ones were designed for the treatment of narcolepsy, so things like modafinil or armodafinil that are designed to created wakefulness, they are all essentially chemical variants of things that increase epinephrine and dopamine. Now, of course, I'm of the standpoint that things like cocaine and amphetamine are just across the board bad, they have so many addictive and terrible effects, in the proper setting prescribed by the proper professional, things like modafinil for narcolepsy might be appropriate, I know that a lot of people out there take Adderall, even though they haven't been prescribed Adderall, in order to increase wakefulness, that is essentially, well, it's illegal for one, but also it's abusing the system in the sense that you're pushing back on the adenosine system slightly differently than you do caffeine, it will make you feel more alert, there tends to be a heavy rebound and they do have an addictive potential, there are also some other effects of those that could be quite bad, so we're gonna explore stimulants in a whole month related to drugs, but there are some supplements and some things that are safer, certainly safer, and that, in cases where you're doing all the right behaviors, you're exercising and eating correctly and you're still having trouble with sleep, that can be beneficial for falling and staying asleep. Now, I wanna be very clear, I am not pushing supplements, I am just pointing you toward some things that have been shown in peer-reviewed studies to have some benefit. The first one is magnesium, there are many forms of magnesium, but certain forms of magnesium can have positive effects on sleepiness and the ability to stay asleep, mainly by way of increasing neurotransmitters like GABA which help turn off the DPO, the kind of thinking about the future, duration-path-outcome analysis, and make one's mind kind of drift in space and time and make it easier to fall asleep, there are a lot of forms of magnesium out there, but in particular is magnesium threonate, T-H-R-E-O-N-A-T-E, which you have to check to see if this is right for you, check with your doctor, but magnesium threonate is associated with transporters in the body that bring more of it into cells that allow people to feel this kind of drowsiness and help them fall asleep, so I personally, I can only talk about what I personally do, I personally take 3 or 400 milligrams of magnesium threonate about 30 to 60 minutes before sleep, and it helps me fall asleep. The other thing is theanine, T-H-E-A, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E, theanine, 100 to 200 milligrams of theanine, for me, also helps me turn off my mind and fall asleep, I take it 30 to 60 minutes throughout the day. Interestingly, theanine is now being introduced to a lot of energy drinks in order to take away the jitters that are associated with drinking too much caffeine or with some other things that are in the energy drinks, energy drinks can be problematic, they can contain a lot of L-taurine, I'll just tell you an anecdote, when I was a postdoc, I was drinking a lot of a particular energy drink, it has a lot of taurine in it, and actually the whites of my eyes, the sclera, as it's called, of my eyes turned beet red, and I went to a friend who's an ophthalmologist, I said, "Look, I'm not a marijuana smoker, "I haven't been hit on the head, "I don't know what's going on," and he looked and he said, "I think you've got some microvascular damage," and we walked through what I was taking and doing, and he said, "Oh, it's probably the taurine, "excessive levels of taurine "can create some microvascular damage." So if you're having microvascular damage in your eye, you probably have microvascular damage deeper in your skull, so I stopped, that's the reason why I don't take energy drinks, so just a consideration, again, I'm not here to tell you what to do or not do, but just wanna arm you with information. The thing about theanine and magnesium is taken together, they do, for some people, they can make them so sleepy and sleep so deeply that they actually have trouble waking up in the morning, so you have to play with these things and titrate them if you decide to use them, again, if you decide to go this route, I would not start by taking supplements, I would start by getting your light-viewing behavior correct, and then think about your nutrition and then think about your activity and then think about whether or not you wanna supplement, we already talked about melatonin earlier. There's another supplement that could be quite useful, which is apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, which is a derivative of chamomile, 50 milligrams of apigenin also can augment or support this kind of creation of a sleepiness to help fall asleep and stay asleep. A note about sleepwalkers and people with very vivid dreams, theanine can often make your dreams very vivid, sleepwalkers should be careful about taking theanine, everyone should be careful about taking anything, and don't take anything without consulting your board-certified M.D. or healthcare professional first, okay? Your health is your responsibility, I am not gonna take responsibility for what you decide to do experimentally in any case, but especially as it relates to supplementation and drugs. As a important point, apigenin is a fairly potent estrogen inhibitor, so women who want to keep their estrogen levels high, or at whatever levels they happen to be at, should probably avoid apigenin altogether, and men, take that into consideration as well, men need estrogen also, you don't wanna completely eliminate your estrogen, that it can create all sorts of bad effects on libido and cognition, et cetera, so apigenin in some people is gonna be a pretty strong estrogen inhibitor, so keep that in mind. There are other things you can take to help you sleep better, those are the legal ones that, at least I'm aware of, have pretty broad safety margins, but again, you need to explore your safety margins with any compound. I think a great website that I can refer you to is examine.com, examine, the word, just as it sounds, .com, is a website, I have no relation to them, but there, you can find links to peer-reviewed studies for any compound or supplement, as well as some important warnings related to the things I discussed, as well as any other thing that you might decide to supplement with or ingest to help improve your sleep. Okay, that was a lot of information about how to get better at sleeping, falling asleep, wakefulness, et cetera. An important feature of this podcast, as you know, is that we dive deep into topics for several episodes at a time, at least a month at a time, so by stopping here, I recognize that there are probably many more questions that you still have, and the great thing about that is that we have another episode coming up soon, I'm going to hold office hours where I'm going to answer your specific questions about episodes one and two, so if you have questions about this episode, you have questions about episode one, write them down, put them in the comments, I'll also do a post on Instagram where you can put them in the comments there, but put them in the comments to this episode as well, please recommend the podcast if you like it, please subscribe to it here on YouTube, please subscribe to it on Apple, we're now on Spotify as well, recommend it to a friend, the community that we're creating here around these topics of sleep and wakefulness and other neuroscience- and health-related themes is best supported by your involvement and your questions, and so I'm going to be reading all of your questions, distilling those into the most commonly asked questions and liked questions, so if you see something below that you are particularly interested in, you don't have to put that question in again, you can just give it a like, the little thumbs-up tab, and if you're listening to this on Spotify or Apple, please go to YouTube, subscribe, and put your question there, or check out the Huberman Lab Instagram and you can put your questions there so that next episode, I can answer those questions and then we can move forward even more deeply into these critical topics around sleep and wakefulness so that you can be armed with all the information and resources that you need. Last but not least, a number of you have very graciously asked how you can support the podcast, the best way to support the podcast is to subscribe on YouTube or one of the other platforms, we are now on Spotify and Apple, and the other way you can really support the podcast is to check out our sponsors, which were discussed at the beginning.

		transcript: `Joe Rogan podcast check it out The Joe Rogan Experience Train by day Joe Rogan podcast by night all day what's up man good to see you glad to be on the show my my pleasure thanks for having me my pleasure what's Kraken how you doing doing all right we were just talking about how you're still trapped in La I'm still trapped in La I know it's you're friends with a lot of people out here have you thought about uh jettison I uh I talk about it all the time and uh it's but you know it's always talk is often a substitute for action it's always does it does it lead to action or does it does it end up substituting for action and uh that's a good point but I have endless conversations about leaving I moved from San Francisco to LA back in 2018 that felt uh felt about as big a move away as possible and uh I keep I keep the the extreme thing I keep saying and again I have to keep in mind talks as a substitute for Action the extreme thing I keep saying is I can't decide whether to leave the state or the country oh boy and uh if you went out of the country where would you go man I've uh it's it's it's tough to find places because uh you know there are a lot of problems in the US and most places are doing so much worse yeah so it's not a good move to leave here [ __ ] up as this place is but but I keep uh I keep I keep thinking I I shouldn't move twice so I should either I can't decide whether I should move to Florida or should move to you know New Zealand or Costa Rica or something like that yeah yeah go full John McAfee and so I but can't decide between those two so I end up stuck in California well Australia is okay but they're even worse when it comes to rule of law and what they decide to make you do and the way they're cracking down on people now for online speech and it's it's very sketchy in other countries it's uh but somehow somehow the uh the the relative outperformance of the US and the absolute stagnation decline of the US they they're actually related things because uh the way the conversation's grouped every time I say tell someone you know I'm thinking about leaving the country they'll they'll do what you you say and they'll say well every place is worse and then that somehow distracts us from all the problems in this country and then we can't talk about what's what's uh what's gone wrong in the US because you know everything is uh everything's so much worse you know well I think most people know what's gone wrong but they don't know if they're on the side of the government that's currently in power they don't know how to criticize it they don't know exactly what to say what should be done right and they're ideologically connected to this group being correct right so they try to do mental gymnastics to try to support some of the things that are going on I think that's that's a part of the problem I don't think it's necessarily we don't know what the problems are we we know what the problems are but we don't have Clear Solutions as to how to fix them nor do we understand the real mechanisms of how they got there in the first place yeah I mean so there there are a lot that are that are pretty obvious to to articulate and uh they're much easier describe than than solved like we have a crazy crazy budget deficit yeah and presumably you have to do one of three things um you have to raise taxes a lot you have to cut spending a lot or um you're just going to keep borrowing money isn't there like some enormous amount of our taxes that just go to the deficit it's it's not it's not that high but it's gone up a lot and what is it what is it didn't I thought it was like 34% or something czy it peaked at 3 point I want to say it peaked at 3.1% of GDP which is you know um maybe um 15 20% of the budget peed 3.1% of GDP in 1991 and then it went all the way down to something like one and a half% in the mid-2010s and now it's crept back up to 3.1 3.2% and so we are at all-time highs as a percentage of GDP and the way to understand the basic math is the uh the debt went up a crazy amount but the interest rates went down and from you know 2008 to 2021 for 13 years we basically had zero interest rates with you know one brief blip under um Powell but it was basically zero rates and then you could have borrow way more money and it wouldn't show up in servicing the debt because you just paid zero% interest on the t t bills and um and the thing that's that's very dangerous seeming to me about the current fiscal situation is um the interest rates have gone back to positive like they were in the 90s and early 2000s um uh mid 2000s and um and it's just this incredibly large debt and so we now have a we now have a real runaway deficit problem but you know people have been talking about this for 40 years and uh crying wool for 40 years so it's it's very hard for people to take it seriously most people don't even understand what it means like when you say there's a deficit we owe money okay to who how's that work um uh it's well it's to yeah people who who bought uh who bought the bonds and it's you know it's a lot of it's to Americans some of them are held by the Federal Reserve decent amount are held by by by foreigners at this point because uh you know it's it's it's in some ways it's the opposite of the of the um trade current account deficits the US has been running these big current account deficits and and the foreigners end up with way more dollars than they than they want to spend on American goods or services and so they have to reinvest them in the US you know some some put it into houses or stocks but a lot of it just goes into into government debt so in in some ways it's a function of the of the chronic trade imbalances chronic trade deficits well if you had supreme power if uh Peter teal was the ruler of the world and you could fix this what would you do man I always find I always find that hypothetical it's it's a ridiculous hypothetical you ridiculous hypotheticals you get ridiculous answers I want a ridiculous answer that's what I like but but what could be done like what could be done first of all what could be done to mitigate it and what could be done to solve it you know I I think I think my I think my answers are probably all in the in the you know in the in the very libertarian Direction so I it would be sort of figure out ways to have smaller governments figure out ways you know you know to um increase the age on Social Security means test Social Security so not everyone gets it just figure out ways to to gradually dial back uh you know a lot of these government benefits um and then that's you know that's insanely unpopular so it's it's completely unrealistic on that level that bothers people that need Social Security I said means tested means tested so people who don't need it don't get it right so Social Security like even if you're very wealthy I don't even know how it work Works do you still get it yeah basically anyone who pretty much everyone gets it because it was orig originally um rationalized as a uh as a um as sort of a pension system not as a welfare system and so the the fiction was you pay social security taxes and then um you're entitled to get a pension out in the form of Social Security right and um and because it was uh we told this fiction that it was a form of uh it was a pension system instead of an intergenerational Ponzi scheme or something something like that um you know the fiction means everybody gets paid Social Security because it's a pension system whereas if we were more honest and said it's you know it's just a welfare system maybe you could you could start dialing uh you could you could you could probably rationalize in a lot of ways and it's it's not related to how much you put into it right like how does Social Security work in terms it's partially I think it's partially related so I think there is uh I'm not a total expert on this stuff but I think um I think there's some guaranteed minimum you get and then um and then and then if you put more in you get somewhat more and then it's it's capped at a certain amount and even that's that's why that's why Social Security taxes are capped at something like you know $150,000 a year and then this is you know this is one of the this is one of the really big tax increase proposals that's out there is to is to uncap it which would effectively be a 12 .4% income tax hike you know oh wow all your income just to Social Security sure because uh the the argument is the argu the the the sort of progressive left Democrat argument is that uh is that it's you know why should you have a regressive Social Security tax why should you pay 12.4% or whatever the Social Security tax is which half gets paid by by you half gets paid by your employer but then it it's capped at like 140 150 50k some level like that and why should be regressive where if you make 500k or a million k a year you pay zero tax on your marginal income and that makes no sense if it's a welfare program if it's a if it's a retirement Savings Program and your your payouts capped then you know if you you don't need to put in more then you get out well that's logical but there's not a lot of logic going on with the way people are talking about taxes today like California just jacked their taxes up to 14 what was it 144 something like that yeah 143 I think which is maybe more yeah 149 something yeah you want more money for doing a terrible job and having more people leave for the first time ever in like the history of the state yeah but it look it it gets away with it I know and uh and so well people are forced with no choice what are you gonna do um it is it is I mean I mean there are people at the margins who leave but uh but the state government still collect it's more and more in revenues so it's you know you get I don't know you get 10% more revenues and 5% of the people leave you still you still increase the amount of revenues you're getting it's uh it's it's it's inelastic enough that you you're actually able to increase the Reven I mean this is sort of the the crazy thing about California is uh you know there there's always sort of a right-wing or libertarian critique of California that you know it's it's such a ridiculous place it it should just collapse um under its own Ridiculousness and uh it doesn't quite happen you know um the macroeconomics on it are are pretty good you know 40 million people the GDP is around four trillion it's about the same as Germany with 80 million or Japan with 125 million Japan has three times the population of California same GDP means onethird the per capita GDP so there's some level on which you know California as a whole is working even though it doesn't work from a governance point of view doesn't work for a lot of the people who live there and uh the the rough model I have for how to think of California is that it's kind of like Saudi Arabia and you have a crazy religion wokeism in California wahhabism in Saudi Arabia you know not that many people believe it but it it distorts everything and then um and then you have like oil fields in Saudi Arabia and you have the big tech companies in California and the oil pays for everything and then you have a completely bloated inefficient government sector and uh and you have sort of all sorts of distortions in the real estate market where uh people also make uh lots of money and sort of the government and real estate are ways you redistribute the oil wealth or the uh you know the the big Tech uh the big Tech money in in California and um and it's like it's it's not the way you might want to design a system from scratch but it's it's pretty stable and people been saying Saudi Arabia is ridiculous it's going to collapse any year now they've been saying that for 40 or 50 years but you know if you have a giant oil field you can pay for a lot of ridiculousness I think that's that's the way to that's that's the way you have to think of California well the other thing is you're also there things about it that are ridiculous but there's something about it that you know it um it doesn't naturally self-destruct overnight well there's a lot of Kick-Ass people there and there's a lot of people that are still generating enormous amounts of wealth there and it's too difficult to just pack up and leave yeah I think it's something like four of the eight or nine companies with Market capitalizations over a trillion dollars are based in California so it's that's amazing it's Google Apple now Nvidia meta um think yeah I think I think broadcom's close to that and there's no ideal place to live either it's not like California sucks so there's a place that's got it totally dialed in with all also that has an enormous GDP also has an enormous population all there's not like one big city that's really dialed in well it's there are there are things that that work so I looked I looked at all the zero tax states in the US and uh and it's always you don't I think the way you ask the question gets at it which is you don't live in a you know in theory a lot of stuff happens on a state level but you don't live in a state you live in a city and so um if you're somewhat biased towards living in at least a moderately sized city um okay I can there are I think there are four states where there are no cities Alaska Wyoming um South Dakota New Hampshire there's zero tax but um no cities to speak of um and then you have um then you have Washington state with Seattle where the weather is the worst in the country you have um Nevada with Las Las Vegas which I'm not that big a fan of and then that leaves three three zero tax states you have Texas which I like as a state but I'm not that big a fan of Austin Dallas or Houston and I you know it's a sort of um Houston is just sort of an oil town which is good if you're in that business but otherwise not um Dallas has sort of a inferiority complex to LA in New York you know just not not the healthiest attitude and then um you know I don't know Austin's a government town and a college town and a wannabe hipster San Francisco town so you know my my books are three strikes and you're you're kind of out too and then that leaves um that leaves Nashville Tennessee which was and then uh or Miami South Florida and those those would be my two top choices Miami's fun but I wouldn't want to live there it's a fun place to visit is a little too crazy a little too chaotic little too cocaine fueled a little too party party party I think it's I think it's pretty I think it's pretty segmented from the tourist the tourist strip from everything else it it probably is you know there probably is something a little bit paradoxical about any place that gets lots of tourists where um you know it's it's it's in some sense a Vaca there's some things that are great about because so many tourists go but then in some sense it's um it creates a weird aesthetic because uh the you know the day-to-day Vibe is that you don't you don't work and you're just having fun or something something like that right cuz so many people are going there just to do that and that's that's probably a little bit off with the south Florida the south Florida thing but um but I think it's um and then I think uh and then I think Nashville is is is also sort of its own real place Nashville's great yeah so those those would be my those are the top two I I could live in Nashville no problem yeah I'm probably always I'm always I'm always too uh you know I fifth grade onward since you know 7077 I lived in California and uh and and so I'm just a sucker for the weather and I think there is no place besides Coastal California where you have really good weather year round in the US may maybe Hawaii's pretty good Coastal California is tough to beat and um and you're two hours from the mountains and man it's like you know it's mid August here in Austin this is just it's just brutal is it I I think so really that was too hot for you it was too hot for today's mild well what is it out there like 80 all right 85 96 96 I do so much sauna that I literally don't even notice it I'm outside for hours every day shooting arrows and I don't even notice it well that's uh I I don't know if you're a representative of the average a I don't know but I think you get accustomed to it to me it's so much better than too cold too cold you can die and I know you can die from the heat but you probably won't especially if you have water you'll be okay but you could die from the cold Cold's real so really cold places there's five months out of the Year where your life's in danger where you could do something wrong like if you live in Wyoming and you break down somewhere and there's no one on the road you could die out there that's real you could die from exposure sure there's probably some very deep reason there's been a net migration of people to the the west and the south in the US over California can do no wrong as long as the Earth doesn't move you're good long as there's no tsunamis you're good it is a perfect environment virtually year round it gets a little hot in the summer but again Coastal not at all if you get an 80 degree day in Malu it's unusual you know it's wonderful you got a beautiful Breeze coming off the ocean sun's out everybody's pretty and then and then it's yeah it's it's correlated with confiscatory taxation they all it's all sort of a package deal well it's a scam you know they know you don't want to leave I didn't want to leave California it's [ __ ] great I I I appreciate you left I always I always have the fantasy that if enough people like you leave it'll put pressure on them but it's it's never quite enough never quite enough and it's not going to be it's too difficult for most people it was very difficult for me and I had a bunch of people working for me that were willing to pack up and leave like young Jamie over there but we you know it was tricky you're you're taking your whole business and my business is talking to people that's part of my business my other business is standup comedy so so you left during during Co or I left at the very beginning as soon as they started locking things down I'm like oh these [ __ ] never let March April may0 in May I started looking at houses cool that's when I came to Austin first um I I end I got a place in Miami in September 2020 and um and spent the last you know I've spent the last four winers there so I'm sort of always on the cusp of of uh moving to Florida hard hard to get out of California um but the the thing that's gotten a lot harder about moving relative to four years ago and you know I'd say I think my real estate purchases have generally not been not been great over the years I mean they've done okay but certainly not um not the way uh not the way I've um been able to um make money at all but uh with the one exception was Miami bought it in September 2020 and probably you know fast forward um four years it's up like 100% wow something like that and um and uh and then but then paradoxically this also means it's it's gotten much harder to move there or Austin or or any of these places you know if you um you know if if uh if I relocated my office in La um the people who own houses okay you have to you have to buy a place in Florida it costs twice as much as it did four years ago and then the interest rates have also doubled and so you get a 30-year mortgage you could have locked that in for 3% in 2020 now it's you know maybe 6 and a half 7% so the prices have doubled the mortgages have doubled so it cost you four times as much to buy a house and so uh yeah so there was a moment where people could move during covid and it's it's gotten dramatically harder relative to what it was four years ago well the Austin real estate market went crazy and then it came back down a little bit it's in that down a little bit spot right now where there's a lot of like high-end properties that are still for sale they can't move it's different you know there's not a lot of people moving here now like there was in the boom cuz everything's open everywhere well I I I I I somehow think Austin was linked to California and Miami was linked a little bit more to to New York and um it was a little bit you know all these differences but um Austin was kind of you know a big part of the move where people from Tech from California that moved um moved to Austin you know there's a part of the Miami South Florida thing which was people from finance and New York uh New York City that moved um moved to to Florida and the finance industry is less networked on New York city so I think it is possible for people if you run a you know private Equity Fund or if you work at a bank it's possible for some of those functions to easily be moved to to a different state um the tech industry is cily networked on California like there's probably some way to do it it's um it's uh it's not that easy yeah it makes sense it it makes sense too it's just the sheer numbers I mean when you're talking about all those corporations that are established and based in California there's so many they're so big just the sheer numbers of human beings that live there and work there that are involved in Tech um sure but if it wasn't if it wasn't as networked you know you could you could probably just move you know and maybe these things are networked till they're not you know Detroit was very networked the car industry was super networked on Detroit for decades and decades and Michigan got more and more mismanaged and people thought the network sort of protected them because you know the big three car companies were in Detroit but then you had all the supply chains were also in Detroit and then eventually it was just so ridiculous people moved um started moving the factories outside of that area and it sort of unraveled so that's you know it can also happen with California it'll just take a lot that would be insane if they just abandon all the tech companies in California I mean just look at what happened at Flint Michigan when all the auto factories pulled out well it's it's um look I think you can it's always there all these paradoxical histories you know the the internet the point of the internet in some sense was to eliminate the tyranny of place and that was sort of the idea and then one of the paradoxes about the internet history of the internet was that the internet companies you know were you know were all you know were all centered in um in California then yeah probably there have been different different waves of um of how networked how how non- networked they were I think uh I think probably 2021 uh sort of the the co moving away from California the big thing in Tech was crypto um and um and crypto um had this conceit of a you know alternate currency decentralized away from the central banks but also the crypto companies the um crypto protocols you could do those from anywhere you could do them outside the US you could do them from Miami and so crypto was something where um the tech could naturally um move out of California and and today probably the the um I don't know the core Tech narative is completely flipped to Ai and uh and if and then there's something about AI That's you know very centralized you know I always I had this one liner years ago where it was you know if if we say that crypto is libertarian can we also say that AI is communist or something like this where the you know the natural structure for an AI company looks like it's a big company and then somehow the AI stuff is uh is feels like it's going to be dominated by the the big tech companies in um in the San Francisco Bay area and so that's very the future of tech yeah the um the the the scale the natural scale of the industry tells you that it's uh going to be extremely hard to get out of you know out of the San Francisco Bay Area when you look to the Future and you try to just make a just a guess as to how all this is going to turn out with AI what do you think we're looking at over the next five years man I I think I should start by being modest in answering that question saying that nobody has a clue right which is true they which pretty much all the experts say you know I I would say Let me let me do sort of a history I the Riff I always had on this was that I can't stand any of the buzzwords and I felt AI you know there's all this big data Cloud Compu Computing there were all these crazy buzzwords people had and they always were ways to sort of abstract things and get away from um from uh from reality somehow and um we're not good ways of talking about things and I thought AI was this incredible abstraction because it can mean the next generation of computers it can mean the last generation of computers it can mean anything in between and if you think about the AI discussion in the 2010s pre um open AI chat GPT and the the revolution of the last 2 years but the 2010's AI discussion maybe it was so I'll start with the history before I get to the future but the history of it was it was maybe anchored on two uh two visions of what AI meant and one was um Nick Bostrom Oxford Prof who wrote This Book uh super intelligence 2014 and it was basically AI was going to be this super duper um intelligent thing way way Godlike intelligence way smarter than any any human being and um and then there was sort of the the I don't know the CCP Chinese Communist rebuttal the Kaiu Lee book from 2018 AI superpowers I think subtitle was something like the race for AI between Silicon Valley and China or something like this and um it it was sort of it defined AI as it was fairly low Tech it was just surveillance um you know facial recognition technology um we would just have this sort of totalitarian stalinist monitoring it didn't require very much Innovation it just required that you apply things and basically the subtext was China is going to win because we have no ethical qualms in China about um applying this this sort of basic machine learning to uh to sort of measuring or controlling the the population and those were sort of like say two extreme um competing visions of of what AI would mean in the in the 2010s and that sort of maybe were sort of the anchors of of the AI debate and then um and then you know what what happened in some sense with um chat GPT in late 22 early 23 was um was that uh the achievement you you got you did not get super intelligence it was not just surveillance Tech but it was you you actually got to the Holy Grail of what people would have defined AI as from 1950 to 2010 for the previous 60 years before the 2010s people have always said AI the definition of AI is passing the touring test and the touring test it it basically means that the computer can fool you into thinking that it's a human being and um and um and it's a somewhat fuzzy test because you know obviously you have an expert on the computer a non-expert you know it's you know does does it fool you all the time or some of the time how good is it but to First approximation the touring test you know we weren't even close to passing it in 2021 and then you know chat GPT basically passes the touring test at least for like let's say an IQ 100 average person um it can uh it can um it's passed the touring test and that was that was the Holy Grail that was the Holy Grail of uh AI research for the previous 60 years and and so there's I know there's probably some psychological or sociological history where we can say that this weird debate between Bostrom about super intelligence and Kaiu Le about surveillance Tech was like this almost like psychological suppression people had where they were not thinking they they lost track of the touring test of the Holy Grail of because it was about to happen and it was such a significant such an important thing that you didn't even want to think about it so I'm tempted to give almost a psychological repression theory of of the 2010 debates but um be that as it may the touring test gets uh gets passed and that's yeah that's an extraordinary achievement and then you know may maybe um May and then you know where where does it go from here there probably are ways you can refi refine these it's still going to be you know a long time to apply it there is a question there's this AGI discussion you know will we get artificial general intelligence which is a hopelessly vague concept which you know general intelligence could be just a generally smart human being so is that just a person with an IQ of 130 or is it super intelligence is it Godlike intelligence uh so it's sort of an ambiguous thing um but I I keep thinking that uh maybe the AGI question is less important than passing the touring test if if we got AGI if we got let's say super intelligence if we got that would be interesting to Mr God because um you'd have a competi you'd have competition for being God but um but surely the touring test is more important for us humans because it's either a complement or substitute to humans and so it's yeah it it's going to rearrange the economic cultural political structure of our society in extremely dramatic ways and and I think maybe what's already happened is much more important than anything else that's going to be done and then it's just going to be a long ways in applying it one one last thought the you know the the um the analogy I'm always tempted to go to and it's these things are never historical analogies are never perfect but it's it's that maybe Ai and 2023 24 is like it's like the internet in 1999 where on one level it's clear the internet's going to be big and get very a lot bigger and it's going to dominate the economy it's going to rearrange the society in the 21st century and then at the same time it was a complete bubble and um people had no idea how the business models worked um you know almost everything blew up it it took you know it didn't take that long in the scheme of things it took you know 15 20 years for it to become super dominant but uh it didn't happen sort of in 18 months as people fantasized in in 1999 and uh and maybe maybe maybe what we have in AI is is is something like this it's um figuring out how to actually apply it you know um in sort of all these different ways is going to take something like two decades but but that doesn't distract from it being a really big deal it is a really big deal and I think you're right about the during test I do you think that the lack of acknowledgement or the public celebration or at least this like mainstream discussion like which I think should be everywhere that we've passed the Turing test do you think it's connected to the fact that this stuff accelerates so rapidly that even though we've essentially breach this new territory it we still know that chp5 is is going to be better GPT 6 is going to be insane and then they're working on these right now and that and the change is happening so quickly we're almost a little reluctant to acknowledge where we're at yeah um you know I I have I've often I've you know probably for 15 years or so often been on the side that there isn't that much progress in science or Tech or not as much as Silicon Valley likes to claim and um and even on the AI level I think it's a massive technical achievement it's still an open question you know is it actually going to lead to much higher living standards for everybody you know the internet was a massive achievement how much it it raise people's living standards uh much much trickier question so um so I I I but um but in in this world where not much has happened one of the paradoxes of a of an era of relative Tech stagnation um is that when something does happen we don't even know how to process it so you know I think I think Bitcoin was a i it was a big invention we can debate with it was good or bad but it was a pretty big deal and it was um systematically underestimated for at least you know the first uh um 10 11 years and you know you could you could trade it it went up smoothly for 10 11 years it didn't get repriced all at once because uh we're in a world where nothing big ever happens and um and so we we have no way of processing it when something pretty big happens the internet was pretty big in 99 Bitcoin was moderately big the internet was really big Bitcoin was moderately big and I'd say um passing the Turing test is really big it's on the same scale as the internet and uh and because our our lived experiences that so little has felt like it's been changing for the last few decades we're we're probably underestimating it it's interesting the say that so little we feel like so little has changed CU if you're a person how old are you um same age as you were born 1967 so in our age we've seen all the change right we saw the uh end of the Cold War we saw answering machines we saw VHS tapes then we saw the internet and then where we're at right now which is like this bizarre moment in time where people carry the internet around with them in their pocket every day and these super sophisticated computers that are ubiquitous everybody has one there's incredible technology that's being ramped up every year they're getting better all the time and now there's AI there's AI on your phone you could access chat GPT and a bunch of different programs on your phone and I think that's an insane change I I think that that's one of the most especially with the use of social media it's one of the most bizarre changes I think our culture is ever the most it can be it can be a big change culturally or or politically um but uh the yeah the kinds of questions I I'd ask is how do you measure it economically does it how much does it change GDP how much do it change productivity um and um and certainly um the story I I would generally tell for the last 50 years since the 1970s early 70s is that we've been not absolute stagnation we in an era of relative stagnation where there has been um very limited progress in the world of atoms the world of physical things um um and uh there has been um a lot of progress in the world of bits information computers internet mobile internet you know now now ai what are you referring to when you're saying the the world of physical things um you know it's any um it's well if we had defined technology if we were sitting here in 1967 the year we were born and had a discussion about technology what technology would have meant would it would have meant computers it would have also meant Rockets it would meant supersonic airplanes it would have meant um new medicines it would have meant the Green Revolution in agriculture maybe underwater cities um you know it it sort of had BEC and it because technology simply gets defined as that which is changing that which is progressing and so there's progress on all these fronts T today last 20 years when you talk about technology you're normally just talking about information technology technology has been reduced to meaning computers and that tells you that the structure of progress has been weird there's been this narrow cone a very intense progress around the world of bits around the world of computers and then all the other areas have been relatively stagnant we're not moving any faster you know the Concord got decommissioned in 2003 or whenever um and then with all the low Tech airport security measures it takes even longer to fly to get through all all of them from from from one city to the next you know the highways have gone backwards because they're more traffic jams we haven't figured out ways around those so they're sort of we're literally moving slower than we were 40 or 50 years ago um and um and then yeah some uh and that's that's sort of the uh that's sort of the um and then you know the and then of course um there's also a sense in which uh these the screens and the devices you know have have this effect distracting us from this so you know when you're you know riding a hundred year old Subway New York City and you're looking at your iPhone you can you can look at wow this is this cool new Gadget but you're also being distracted from the fact that your lived environment hasn't changed you know in a 100 years and and and so there's yeah there's a question how important is this world of bits versus versus the world of ad Adams you know I would say as human beings we're physically embodied in a material world and so I I I would always say this world of atams is pretty important and when that's pretty stagnant you know there's a lot of stuff that that doesn't make sense I I was an undergraduate at Stanford late 80s and at the time um in retrospect every engineering area would have been a bad thing to go into you know mechanical engineering chemical engineering all these engineering skills where you were tinkering and trying to do new things because these things turned out to be stuck they were regulated couldn't come up with new things to do nuclear engineering Aero Astro engineering people already knew those were really bad ones to go into they were you know outlawed you weren't going to make any progress in new nuclear reactor designs or stuff like that um electrical engineering which was the one that's sort of adjacent to making semiconductors that one was still okay and then the only field that uh was actually going to progress a lot was computer science and um and again you know it's it's been very powerful but that was not the felt sense in the 1980s in the 1980s computer science was this ridiculous inferior subject um you know I I always the the linguistic cut is always when when people use the word science I'm in favor of science I'm not in favor of Science and quotes and when it's always a tell that it's not real science and so when we call it climate science or political science or social science um you know you're just sort of making it up and you have an inferiority complex to real science which something physics or chemistry and computer science was in the same category as social science or political science it was it was a fake field for people who found electrical engineering or math way too hard and um um and and sort of dropped out of out of the real the real science and real um real engineering Fields you don't feel that climate science is a real science it's it is um it's it's um well let me it's i i i there's several different things one could say it's uh it's possible climate change is happening it's possible we don't have great accounts of why that's going on so I'm not I'm not questioning any of those things but uh but how scientific it is um I I don't think um I don't think it's it's a place where we have really vigorous debates you know maybe the climate is increasing because of carbon dioxide emissions temperatures are going up maybe it's methane maybe it's people are eating too much steak it's the cows flatulating or and you have to measure you how how much is methane a greenhouse gas versus versus carbon dioxide I don't think they're I don't think they're rigorously doing that stuff scientifically and I think the fact that it's called climate science tells you that it's more dogmatic than than than anything that's truly science should be why doesn't Dogma doesn't mean it's wrong but but why is the fact that it's called climate science mean that it's more dogmatic because if you said nuclear science you wouldn't question it right it's yeah but no one calls it nuclear science they call it nuclear engineering because I'm just the only the only thing is I just making I'm just making neing science that is legitimately science well this point people say computer science has worked but right in the 1980s all I'm saying is it was in the same categories let's say social science political science it was it was a it was a tell that the people doing it kind of deep down knew they they weren't doing real science well there's certainly ideology that's connected to climate science and then there's certainly corporations that are invested in this uh this Prospect of green energy and the concept of green energy and they're profiting off of it and pushing these different things whether it be electric car mandates or whatever it is like California I think they it's 30 20 35 they have a mandate that all new vehicles have to be electric which is hilarious when you're connected to a grid that can't support the electric cars it currently has after they said that within a month or two Gavin new asked people to not charge their Teslas because it was summer and the grid was [ __ ] yeah look it's it it it was all linked into all these ideological projects in all these ways and uh there you know there's there's an environmental project which is you know and and maybe maybe it shouldn't be scientific you know there's you know the hardcore environmentalist argument is we only have one planet and we don't have time to do science if we if we have to do rigorous science and you can prove that we're overheating it'll be too late and um and so if you're a hardcore environmentalist you know you don't want to have as high a standard of science yeah my my intuition is certainly when when you go away from that you end up with things that are too dogmatic too ideological may maybe it doesn't even work even if the planet's getting warmer you know maybe climate science is is not like my my question is is car like maybe methane is a worse um is is is it more dangerous greenhouse gas than uh carbon dioxide we're not we're not even capable of measuring that well we're also ignoring certain things like regenerative Farms that sequester carbon that and then you have people like Bill Gate saying that planting trees to deal with carbon is ridiculous it's a ridiculous way to do it like how is that ridiculous is they literally turn carbon dioxide into oxygen it is their food their food that's what the food of plants is that's that's what powers the the whole plant life and the way we have the symbiotic relationship with them like and the more carbon dioxide is the greener it is which is why it's Greener Today on Earth than it has been in a hundred years sure these are all facts that are inconvenient to people that have a very specific narrow window of how to approach this sure although you know there probably are ways to steal man the other side too where um where maybe maybe um you know the the original 1970s you know I think the manifesto that's always very interesting from the other side was this uh book by the club of Rome 1972 the limits of growth and it's you can't have you we need to head towards a society in which there's Zer percent there's very limited growth because if you have unlimited growth you're going to run out of resources if you don't run out of resources you'll hit a pollution constraint but the um in the 1970s it was um you're going to have overpopulation um you're going to run out of oil we had the oil shocks um and then um and then by the 90s it it sort of morphed into more of the pollution problem with uh with carbon dioxide climate change other other environmental things but uh but there is sort of um you know it's you know there's been some you know some improvement in in oil carbon fuels with fracking things like this in Texas it's um it's not at the scale that's been enough to uh um you know give an American standard of living to the whole planet and we consume a 100 million barrels um of oil um you a day globally um maybe fracking can add 10% 10 million to that if everybody on this planet has an American standard of living it's something like three 300 400 million barrels of oil and I don't I don't think that's there so that's that's kind of I I always wonder whether that was the that was the real environmental argument is we can't have an American standard of living for the whole planet we somehow can't justify this degree of inequality and um and therefore you know we have to figure out ways to dial back and you know tax the carbon restrict it and uh and maybe you know maybe that's there's some sort of a malthusian calculus that's more about resources than about pollution um how much of that could the the the demand for oil could be mitigated by nuclear uh it you Pro you probably could mitigate it a lot there's there's a question why the why the nuclear thing has gone so wrong it's um especially if you if you have El Vehicles right you know it's uh um combustion engine is probably hard to get nuclear to work but if you um if you shift to electric vehicles you can you can charge them you know your Tesla cars at night um and that that would seemingly work um and there's definitely yeah there's definitely a history of energy where it was always in the direction of you know more intense use it went from wood to Coal to oil which is a more compact form of energy and in a way takes up less of the environment and then if we move from oil to uranium that's even you know it it's even smaller and so in a sense the smaller the more dense the energy is the less of the environment it takes up and when we go back when we go from oil to natural gas which takes up more space and from natural gas to solar or wind we have to you know you have to pollute the whole environment by putting up windmills everywhere or you have to you know you know you have to cover the whole desert with solar pan that is a good way to look at it it is a form of pollution and so um and so there was a way there was a way that nuclear was supposed to be the uh the the energy mode of the the 21st century and then yeah there there all these there these historical questions why did it why did it get stopped why did we not uh why did we not go down that route the um you know the the standard explanation of why it stopped um was that uh it was um there were all these dangers we had three mile on 1979 you know Chernobyl and um in 1986 and then the Fukushima one in Japan I think 2011 and uh you had these sort of you had these various act accidents um my alternate theory on why uh why nuclear energy really stopped is that it um it was um it was sort of dystopian or even apocalypse itic because it turned out that it was all um it turned out to be very dual use if you build nuclear power plants um uh it's it's only sort of one step away from uh building nuclear weapons and uh and it turned out to be a lot trickier to u to separate those two things out than it looked and I think the you know the signature moment was 1974 or 75 when India gets the nuclear bomb and I the US I believe had transferred the nuclear reactor technology to India we thought they couldn't weaponize it and then it turned out it was pretty easy to weaponize and then the and then sort of the geopolitical problem with uh with nuclear power was you either you know um you need a double standard where we have nuclear power in the us but we don't allow other countries to have nuclear power because the US gets to keep its nuclear weapons we don't let 100 other countries have nuclear weapons and this that's an extreme double standard probably a little bit hard to justify um or um or you need some kind of really effective Global governance where you have a one world government that regulates all this stuff which doesn't sound that good either and uh and then sort of the compromise was just to um to um regulate it so much that uh you know maybe the the nuclear plants got grandfathered in but it became too expensive to build new ones Jesus like even China which is the country where they're building the most nuclear power plants they've built way less than people expected a decade ago because um you know they they don't trust they don't trust their own designs and so they have to copy the over safety overprotected designs from the west and the nuclear plants nuclear power costs too much money it's cheaper to do coal wow so um so you know I'm not get the numbers exactly right but if you look at what percent of Chinese electricity was nuclear it wasn't that high it was like maybe four five% in 2013 2014 and the percent hasn't gone up in 10 years because you know they maybe doubled the amount of electricity they Ed and maybe they doubled the nuclear but the relative percentage is still it's still a pretty small part of the mix because it's just more expensive when you have these you over safety designed reactors there probably ways to build small reactors um that that that are that are way cheaper but then you still have this you still have this dual use thing you know do do you create plutonium do you you know are are there ways you can create a pathway to building more nuclear weapons and if there was Innovation if nuclear engineering had gotten to a point where you know let's say there wasn't Three Mile Island or Chernobyl didn't happen do you think that it would have gotten to a much more efficient and much more effective version by now well my my understanding is there are we we have way we have way more efficient designs we have small you you can do small reactor designs which which are you don't need this giant containment structure so it costs much less per kilowatt hour of of electricity you produce so I I think we have those designs they're they're just not allowed and then but then I think the problem is that um if you were able to build them in all these countries all over the world you still have this dual use problem right and again my alternate history of what really went wrong with nuclear power it wasn't three mland it wasn't Chernobyl that's the that's the official story the real story was India getting the bomb wow that makes sense that completely makes sense gez Louise and then this is you know this is always you know this is always the question about uh um there's always a big picture question people ask me you know uh you know if I'm right about this picture of you know this slowdown in Tech this the sort of stagnation in many many dimensions and then there's always a question you know wh why did this happen and um and my copout answer is always uh why questions are overdetermined uh because you know um it can be there are multiple reasons and so it could be why could be we became a more feminized risk-averse Society could be that uh the education system worked less well it could be that we were just out of ideas the easy ideas have been found the hard ideas the cupboard Nature's cupboard was Bare the low hanging fruit had been picked so that it can be overdetermined but I think I think one dimension that's not to be underrated for the Science and Tech stagnation was that uh an awful lot of Science and Technology had this dystopian or apocalyptic uh Dimension and uh and probably what happened at you know Los Alamos in 1945 and then uh with with the thermonuclear weapons in the early 50s um it took a while for it to really seep in but it had this sort of delayed effect where you know maybe maybe a a stagnant World in which the physicists don't get to do anything and they have to putter around with Dei and um you're not you know um but uh you don't build weapons that blow up the world anymore you know is that a is that a feature or a bug and so the stagnation was sort of was sort of like this this response and so it sucks that we've lived in this world for 50 years where a lot of stuff has been inert but um if we had a world that was still accelerating on all these Dimensions with SuperSonics and Hypersonic planes and Hypersonic weapons and you know modular nuclear reactors maybe we wouldn't be sitting here and the whole world would have already blown up and so we're we're in that we're in the stagnant path of the Multiverse because it had it had this partially protective thing even though in all these other ways I feel it's it's it's deeply deranged our society that's a very interesting perspective and it makes a lot of sense it really does and particularly the Dual use thing with nuclear power and especially Distributing that to other countries when you talk about the stagnation in this country like I don't know how much you follow this whole UAP nonsense I know we met what was that guy's name at your place the uh the guy who did Chariots of the Gods oh fond Anakin yes yeah yeah you you you didn't you thought he was too crazy you you like Hancock but you don't like fond danin H I didn't think he's too crazy he just willfully in my opinion ignores evidence that would show that some of the things that he's saying have already been solved and I think his his hypothesis is all related to this concept that we have been visited and that that's how all these things were built and that this technology was brought here from another world and I think he's very ideologically locked into these ideas and I think a much more compelling idea is that there were very Advanced cultures for some reason 10,000 years ago whatever it was whatever the year was where they they built some of the insane structures it's a 45 100 years ago they roughly think the pyramids were built like what whatever the [ __ ] was going on there I think those were human beings I think those were human beings in that place in that time and I think they had some sort of very sophisticated technology that was lost and things can get lost things can get lost in cataclysms things can get lost in they can get lost in disease and famine and all there's all sorts of War all sorts of reasons the burning of the Library of Alexandria there's all sorts of ways that technology gets lost forever and you can have today someone living in Los Angeles in the most sophisticated high-tech Society the world has ever known while you still have people that live in the Amazon that live in the same way that they've lived for thousands of years so those things can happen in the same Planet at the same time and I think while the rest of the world was essentially operating at a much lower vibration there were people in Egypt that were doing some extraordinary things um I don't know how they got the information maybe they did get it from visitors maybe they did but there's no real compelling evidence that they did I think there's much more compelling evidence that a cataclysm happened um when you look at the younger dras impact Theory it's all entirely based on science it's entirely based on core samples and meridium content and and also massive changes in the environment over a very short period of time particularly the melting of the ice caps in North America and just craters all around the world that we know something happened roughly 11,000 years ago and probably again 10,000 years ago I think it's a regular occurrence on this planet that things go sideways and there's massive natural disasters and I think that it's yeah there there's the Bron age civilization collapse somewhere in the mid 12th century BC and um and probably the um you know in some ways the the one in which we have the best history is the fall of the Roman Empire which was obviously sure the culmination of the classical world and uh it somehow it's somehow extreme extremely unravel so my yeah I think I think my my view on it is probably somewhere between yours and the um the fond Anakin no not fond Anakin I'm more on the uh more on the more on the uh Pro uh the other side let me let me let me try to Define why this agree on why this is so important today this is not just of antiquarian interest and the reason it matters today is because the alternative you know if if if if you say civilization has seen great Rises and Falls it's gone through these great Cycles um you know may maybe the Bronze Age civilizations were very Advanced but someone came up with iron weapons so there was just one dimension where they progressed but then everything else they could destroy and so um uh or you know the fall of the Roman Empire was again this you know pretty cataclysmic thing where there were diseases and you know and then there were political things that unraveled but uh somehow you know was was a massive regression for you know four five 600 years into the into the Dark Ages and um the um the the sort of naive the progressive things always just got monotonically better and there's sort of this revisionist purely Progressive history where even the Roman Empire didn't Decline and even you know this one one one sort of stupid way to quantify this stuff is with pure demographics and so it's the question how many people lived in the past and um and the Rises and Falls of civilization story is there were more people who lived in the Roman Empire because it was more advanced it could support a larger population and then the population decline you know city of Rome maybe had a million people at its peak and then by you know I don't know 650 ad it's maybe it's down to 10,000 people or less you have this complete collapse in population and then um and then the the sort of alternate purely Progressive view is the population has always just been monotonically increasing because it's a measure of how in some sense things in aggregate have have always been getting better so I am I am definitely on your side that population had great Rises and Falls civilizations had great Rises and Falls um um and so that part of it I I I agree with you or even you know some variant of what Hancock or fundana can say uh the the the place where I would say I think things are different is I don't think I don't think um and and and and and therefore it seems possible something could happen to our civilization that's that's always the upshot of it if if it had been monotonically always progressing then there's nothing we should worry about nothing can possibly go wrong and then certainly certainly the thing um the the the sort of alternate Hancock fond danin um Joe Rogan history of the world uh tells us is that uh we shouldn't take our civilization for granted there's there things that can go really hawi I I agree with that the one place where I I is I think I do think our civilization today is on some Dimensions way more advanced than any of these past civilizations were I don't think any of them had nuclear weapons I don't think any of them had um you know spaceships um or or anything like that and uh and so the failure mode is likely to be be be somewhat different from from these These past ones yeah that makes sense um I think uh technology progressed in a different direction that's what I think I think it structural Technology Building Technology had somehow or another achieved levels of competence that's not available today when you look at the construction of the great per of Giza there's 2,300,000 stones in it there the whole thing points to do north south east and west it's an incredible achievement the the stones some of them were moved from a quarry that was 500 miles away through the mountains they have no idea how they did it massive Stones the ones inside the king's chamber where they like the biggest ones are like 80 tons it's crazy the whole thing's crazy like how did they do that like whatever they did they did without Machin supposedly they did without um the the use of uh the combustion engine they didn't have electricity and yet they were able to do something that stands the test of time not just so you could look at it you know like you can go to the Acropolis and see the Parthenon it's gorgeous it's it's amazing it's incredible but I can understand how people could have built it the pyramids is one of those things you just look at you go what the [ __ ] was going on here what was going on here and none of these people are still around you you have this strange culture now that's entirely based around you know you have Cairo and an enormous population of visitors right which is a lot of it people just going to St these relics what what was going that those people were so much more advanced than anyone anywhere else in the world yeah I would I I I'm not sure I would anchor on the technological part but I think I think the the piece that is very hard for us to comprehend is what motivated them culturally well how did they do it physically why why did they do it why why were you motiv so why but also how how is a big one because that it's really difficult to solve there's no traditional conven explanations for the construction the movement of the stones the amount of time that it would taken if you move 10 stones a day I believe it takes 664 years to make one of those pyramids so how many people were involved how long did it take how'd they get them there how' they figure out how to do it how come the shittier pyramids seem to be dated later like what what was going on in that particular period of time where they figured out how to do something so extraordinary that even today 4,500 years later we stare at it and we go I don't know I don't know what the [ __ ] they did I I haven't studied it carefully enough I'll I'll Trust you that it's very hard I think the the I think the I would say the the real mystery is why were they motivated and it's because you can't live in a pyramid it's just it was just the afterlife of the Pharaoh there's some debate about that Christopher Dunn as an engineer who believes that it was some sort of a power plant he's got this very bizarre theory that there was a chamber that exists if you can see you see the structure of the pyramid the inside of it there's a chamber that's Subterranean and he believes this Subterranean chamber was pounding on the surface of the of the earth and of the walls of the thing creating this very specific vibration they had shafts that came down into the Queen's chamber these shafts they would pour chemicals into these shafts and then there was limestone at the end of it this is all his theory not mine um the end of it there was this Limestone which is permeable right so the Limestone which is porous these gases come through and creates this hydrogen that's inside of this chamber then there these shafts inside the king's chamber that are they're they're getting uh energy from space you know gamma rays and all the [ __ ] from space and that it's going through these Chambers which are very specifically designed to Target this these gases and put them into this chamber where they would interact with this energy and he believes it's enough to create electricity man my it's a crazy Theory but look I'm always I'm always too uh too fast to buk all these things but um like my just coming back to our earlier conversation it it sound it it must have been a crazy power print to have a containment structure much bigger than a nuclear reactor yeah well it's ridiculous but it's also a different kind of Technology right if nuclear technology was completely not on the table they didn't understand atoms at all but they did understand that there's rays that come from space and that you could somehow harness the energy of these things with specific gases and through some method con con that into some form of electricity but it if it takes so much power to put all these rocks on the pyramid you have to always look at how efficient the power plant is so um so it can't just be some it has to be like the the craziest reaction ever to justify such a big containment structure because even nuclear power plants don't work economically barely work it well they didn't do a lot of them you know they only did this one in Giza and then there was other pyramids that he thinks had different functions that were smaller but the whole purpose of it is or the whole point of it is we we don't know what the [ __ ] it is we don't know why they did it we have uh a group of new archaeologists that are looking at it from a completely different Theory they're not looking at it like it's a tomb the established archaeologists have insisted that this is a tomb for the Pharaoh the newer archaeologists established archaeologists are looking at it and considering whether or not there were some other uses for this thing and one of them is the concept of the par I'm always I don't know if this is an alternate history Theory but I I'm always into the James Frasier golden B Renee Gerard violence sacred history where um you know you have always this question about um the origins of monarchy and kingship and um the the sort of Gerard Frasier intuition is um that uh it's something like um it is something like if um if every King is a kind of living God then uh we have to also believe the opposite that maybe every God is a dead or murdered King and that uh that somehow societies were organized around scapegoats the scapegoats were um you know there was sort of a crisis in the archaic Community it got blamed on a scapegoat the scapegoat was attributed all these powers and then at some point the scapegoat before he gets executed figures out a way to postpone his execution and turn the power into something real and so there's sort of this this very um weird adjacency between mon the Monarch and the scapegoat and uh and then you know I don't know the sort of Riff on the would be that the first pyramid did not need to be invented it was just the stones that were thrown on a victim and then it somehow and that that's the original the original stones that were thrown on a victim a community Stones a victim to death tribe runs after a victim you Stone him to death you throw stones on the victim that's how you create the first Tomb H and then um and then as it gets more complicated you create a tomb that's two million stones and and you get a you get a pharaoh you get a pharaoh who figures out a way to postpone his own execution or something like this I I think there's um I'm going to blank on the name of this ritual but I believe in old in in the old Egyptian kingdoms which were sort of around the time of the Great Pyramids or even before um there it was something like um in the 30th year of the reign of the Pharaoh the Pharaoh gets transformed into a living God and um and then um this perhaps dates to a time where um in the 30th year of the pharaoh's Reign the Pharaoh would get ritually sacrificed or or killed and you have you know you have all these societies where the Kings lived were allowed to rule for an a lot of time where you you know you you become king and you you draw the number of Pebbles out of a vase and that corresponds to how many years was this Jamie the said Festival HEB said Festival of tale was an ancient Egyptian ceremony that celebrated the continued rule of pharaoh the name was taken from the name of the Egyptian wolf God one of whom's name was whip this is what I'm talking about or said the less formal Feast name the Feast of the tale is to yeah next paragraph is the one to start okay no that that one right there the the ancient Festival might perhaps have been instituted to replace a ritual of murdering a pharaoh who was unable to continue to rule effectively because of age or condition interesting interesting so you can't kill him now and then eventually said festivals were Jubilee several had thrown for 30 years and then every 3 to four years after that so when it becomes Unthinkable to kill the Pharaoh the Pharaoh gets turned into a living God before that the Pharaoh gets murdered and then gets worshiped as a dead Pharaoh or distant God that's interesting but it still doesn't solve the engineering puzzle the engineering puzzle is the biggest one like how did they do that well the one the one I'm focusing on is the motivational puzzle even if you have all the motivation in the world if you want to build a structure that's insane to build today and you're doing it 4,500 years ago we're dealing with a massive puzzle I I think I think I think the motivational part's the harder one to solve if if if you can figure out the motivation you'll you'll you'll figure out a way to organize the whole society and if you can figure out if you can get the whole society working on it you can probably do it but don't you think that his grasp on of power was in Peril in the first place which is why they decided to come up with this idea of turning them into a living God so to to have the amount of resources and power and then the engineering and then the understanding of whatever methods they use to shape and move these things well this is always the um this is always the anthropological debate between voler the enlightenment thinker of the 18th century and durkheim the 19th century Anthropologist and uh voler believes that um Rel religion originates as a conspiracy of the priests to maintain power and so politics comes first the politicians invent religion um and then durkheim says the causation the other way around that somehow religion came first and then politics somehow came out of it now of course you know once the politics comes out of it um you know the the priests the religious authorities have political power they figure out ways to manipulate it things like this but uh but I I find you know I find the durkheim story far more plausible than the volar one I think the religious categories are are primary and the the political categories are are are secondary so you think the religious the religion came first but what about if we emanated from tribal societies tribal societies have always had leaders when you have leaders you're going to have dissent you're going to have challenges you're going to have politic and you have people negotiating to try to maintain power keep power keep everything organized that's the origin of politics correct uh you know I I I think that's a that's a whitewashed Enlightenment rationalist description of the origin of politics yeah what do you think the origin of politics is I think it's far more vile than that you know what you're what you're giving me is well it's very vile the control and power and maintaining power involves murder and sabotage well that okay that's more like it but what you what what what what you gave me a minute ago sounds more like a social contract theory in which people sit down negotiate and have you know a nice legal chitchat to drop the social contract that is a complete fiction yeah I don't think that I think that there was probably various levels of Civility that were achieved when Agriculture and when establishments were constructed that were near resources where they didn't have to worry as much about food and water and things along those lines things probably got a little bit more civil but I think that the origins of it are like the origins of all human conflict it's filled with murder well I think at the beginning was Madness and murder yeah Madness and murder and and I don't know I don't I don't know if it got I don't know if it got that much more rational I don't know if it's that much more rational today well so in some ways it's not right this again this again back to the you know the the progressive conception are we you know are we really have we really progressed how much have we really progressed from from that but but uh but yeah I my my uh my version would be that it was you know it was much more um um it was organized around you know acts of uh Mass violence like maybe maybe you externalize it onto you know a Mastadon or hunting some big animal or something like this but uh but the real problem of violence you know it wasn't external it was mostly internal it was it was violence with people who were near you proximate to you um it wasn't even natural CL cataclysms or other tribes it was it was uh it was sort of um much more uh the internal stuff and um it's very different I think the the human situation is somehow very very different from something like I don't know an ape primate hierarchy where you know in an ape context you have an alpha male um you know he's the strongest and there's some sort of natural dominance and you don't need to have a fight to the death typically because you know who's the strongest and you don't need to um push it all the way in a human context it's always possible for two or three guys to gang up on the alpha male so uh so it's uh it's somehow the culture is more important you know and if they can talk to each other and you get language and then they can coordinate and they can gang up on on the leader and then you have to stop them from gting up on the leader and how how do you do that and so the there's some sort of radical difference between a you know a human and a let's say an um a prehuman world have you seen chimp Empire no chimp Empire is a fascinating documentary series on Netflix where these scientists had been embedded with this tribe of chimpanzees for decades and so because they were embedded they had very specific rules you has to maintain at least 20 yards from you and any of the chimps no food you can never have food and don't look them in the eyes and as long as you do that they don't feel you're a threat and they think of you as a natural part of their environment almost like you don't exist they and they behave completely naturally well it shows in that that sometimes it's not the largest strongest one and that some chimps form bonds with other chimps and they form coalitions and they do have some sort of politicking and they do help each other they groom each other they do specific things for each other and then one of the things that happens also they get invaded by other chimps and that chimps leave and they go on patrol and other chimps gang up on them and kill them and they try to fight and battle over resources so it's not nearly as cut and dry as the strongest chimp prevails because one of the chimps that was dominant was an older chimp and he was smaller than some of the other chimps but he had formed a coalition with all these other chimps and they all respected him and they all knew that they would be treated fairly and being treated fairly is a very important thing with chimpanzees they get very jealous if they think that things are not fair which is why that guy was attacked and you know that guy who had a um pet chimpanzee he brought it a birthday cake the other chimps weren't getting a piece of the cake and they someone had [ __ ] up and left a door open they got out and mauled this guy because he didn't give them some of the cake yeah so I I find all of that quite plausible but I think both of us can be correct so there's some the the the true story of harmonization of how we became humans there's a way to tell it where it's continuous with our animal past and where it's just you know there's things like this with the chimpanzees or the baboons or you know um other primates and then um there is a part of the story that I think is also more discontinuous um and um you know my my judgment is we probably you know in a in a darwinian context we always stress the continuity um you know I'm I'm always a little bit the contrarian and so um you I Believe In Darwin's theory but uh I think uh I think uh we should also be skeptical of ways it's too dogmatic and uh and Darwin's theories make us gloss over the discontinuities and I think you know the one one type of happen overnight but one type of Fairly dramatic discontinuity is that um you know is that humans have something like language and even though you know chimpanzees probably I don't know they have an IQ of 80 or they're pretty they're pretty smart but but when you don't have a rich symbolic system um that that leads to sort of a very very different kind of structure and and there's something about uh um uh language and the kind of coordination that allows and the ways that it forces you to it enables you to coordinate on violence and then it encourages you to channel violence in certain sacred religious directions um uh I think uh creates a you know something radically different about human society we're you know we differ you know we we tell humans tell each other stories um a lot of the stories are not true true they're myths but uh that's that is a that's I think that's an some some sort of a very important difference from uh from even our closest uh uh uh primate uh primate relatives um but that you know this is again this is sort of like another way of getting at what's uh so crazy about uh chat GPT and passing the touring test because if we had sat here two years ago and you asked me you know what what is the distinctive feature of a human being what makes someone a human and you know how and in a way that differs from everybody else um you know it's not perfect but my go-to answer would been language you're you know you're threeyear old you're an 80y old you know just about all humans can speak languages just about all non-humans cannot speak languages it's this it's this binary thing and then that's that's sort of a way of telling us again why why passing the touring test was way more important than super intelligence or anything else yeah I could see that I don't want go back to that tangent no it's a good tangent great keep tangent and off have fun it's great um do you think what what do you think the factor was there's a lot of debate about this like the factor was that separated us from these animals and why we became what we became CU we're so vastly different than any other primate like so what do you think took place like the doubling of the human brain size over a period of 2 million years is one of the greatest mysteries in the entire fossil record we don't know what the [ __ ] happened there's a lot of theories the throwing arm cooking meat there's a lot of theories but we we really have no idea well again if I if I let me do sort of linguistic riff I think um Aristotelian darwinian biology Aristotle you always differ things by put them in categories and and uh um man I think the line Aristotle has is something man differs from the other animals in his greater aptitud ude for imitation and um and and I would say uh it that um we are these giant imitating machines and of course the darwinian Riff on this is you know to imitate is to ape and um and so we differ from the AP we're more aplike than the Apes we are far better at aping each other than the apes are and um and that uh to you know a first cut I would say our brains are giant imitation machines that's how you learn language as a kid you imitate your parents uh and that's how culture gets transmitted but then um there are a lot of dimensions of imitation that uh that are also very dangerous because um it's not imitation doesn't just happen on this symbolic linguistic level it's also you imitate things you want you want a banana I want a banana you want a blue ball I can have a red ball I want a blue ball because you have a blue ball and um and and so there's something about imitation that um you know creates culture um you know that uh um that is incredibly important pedagogically learning you know it's how you master something how you know in all these different ways and then um and then a lot of it has this uh has this incredibly conflictual Dimension as well and uh and then there's yes so I think I think that was sort of core to the things that are both great and troubled about humanity and and uh and that was sort of that was in some ways the problem that that needed to be solved so you think that the motivation of imitation is the the essential first steps that led us to become human um there's some story like and again this is a one-dimensional one explanation fits all but yeah the EXP sort of the explanation I would I would go with is that it was it was something like um you know our brains got bigger and so we were more powerful imitation machines and there were things about that that were you know that were um yeah that made us a lot more powerful and a lot we could learn things and we could remember things and there was cultural transmission that happened but then um it also we could build better weapons and we became more violent and um it it also had a very very destructive element and then somehow the imitation you know had to be had to be channeled in in these sort of ritualized religious you know kinds of ways and that's that's that's why um I I think all these things sort of somehow came to up together in parallel what about the physical adaptation like what would be the motivation of the animal to change form and to have its brain grow so large and to lose all its hair and to become soft and fleshy like we are as opposed to like rough and durable like almost every other primate is well you can always man you can always tell these retrospective Just So Stories and how this all all worked out but it it would seem the the naive retrospective story would be that uh um you know there are a lot of ways that humans are I don't know less strong than the other apes or you know there all all these ways where we're in some sense weaker physically at least physically but um but maybe it was just this basic trade-off you you know yeah more more of your energy went into your mind and into your brain and um and then you know um you you were your fist wasn't as strong but you could build a better Axe and that made you stronger than an ape and that's that's yeah where where you know a brain with you know less I don't know less energy was spent on growing a hair to keep warm in the winter and and then you used your brain to build an Axe and skin a bear and get get some fur for the winter some something like that yeah I guess it's just but it's just such a leap it's such a leap and different than any other animal like and like what was the primary motivating factor like what the thing you know McKenna believes it was psilocybin you know I'm sure you probably ever heard that theory McKenna's Stone ape Theory which is a fasina any one but there's a lot of different theories about what took place but we're just well the one yeah the one I would go on was that there was this dimension of increased imitation there was some kind of cultural linguistic Dimension that was incredibly um important um it probably was also you know it was probably also uh somehow linked to uh to uh you know dealing with um all the violence that came with it all the conflicts that that that came with it um you know I would be I'd be more open to the stoned ape theory if people um I had this conversation with the other guy mura rescu the immortality key Guy and um I always feel they whitewash it too much how's so you know it's like if I mean if if you had these crazy Dian rituals in which people you know if you know there's probably lots of crazy sex there was probably lots of crazy violence that was was tied to it and and so maybe like maybe you'd be out of your mind to be hunting a woolly mammoth and like maybe maybe you can't be completely you know but they weren't hunting Willie Mammoth during the ucini Mysteries no but you were I don't know you went to went to war to fight the neighboring tribe it's probably more dangerous than hunting right but they also did absolutely have these rituals and they have absolutely found Trace elements of I don't I don't question that okay I don't question that at all I I I just I I I just I just think uh they they probably part of it was ALS also uh was a way to channel violence was probably you know whenever I don't know was there some some degree to which um whenever you went to war you were on drugs you were well we know about the Vikings the Vikings most certainly took mushrooms before they went into battle and um and you know maybe it makes you less less coordinated or something but but if you're just if you're less scared that's probably it doesn't make you less coordinated if you're just a little bit less scared that's probably super important it increases visual Acuity there's a lot of benefits that would happen physically especially if you got the dose right you know um it increases visual Acuity edge detections better uh makes people more sensitive probably more aware probably a better Hunter and uh but I think I I I'm I'm I'm sympathetic to all all these um mushrooms um psychedelic drug historical usage theories I suspect was very widespread um I just think you know a lot of it was in in these contexts that uh that were pretty trans aggressive yeah I think um they're not mutually exclusive I think just giving the the way the world was back then for sure violence was everywhere violence was a part of daily life violence was a part of how Society was kept together violence was entertainment in Rome right for sure violence was uh was everything was a big part of it and I think release and and the anxiety of that violence also LED people to want to be intoxicated and do different things that uh separated them from a normal State of Consciousness um but I do think it's also probably where democracy came from I I think having those ilian mystery rituals where they would get together and do psychedelics and under this very controlled set and setting I think that's the birthplace of a lot of very interesting and innovative ideas I think a lot of interesting and innovative ideas currently are are being at least uh dreamt up thought of they have their roots in some sort of altered conscious experience well um it's man I I don't know I I think this stuff is very powerful I think it is it is I definitely think it shouldn't be outlawed you know pretty hardcore libertarian on all the drug legalization stuff uh and then I I do I do Wonder um I do Wonder exactly how how how how how these things work it probably you know probably the classical World version of it um was that it was something that you did in a fairly controlled setting you didn't do it every day um and it was it was sort of it was some it was some way uh I imagine to get you know a very different perspective on your 9 to-5 job or whatever you want to call it but uh you didn't necessarily want to you know want to really DeCamp to the other world altoe oh for sure it's too dangerous to do um I don't think anybody thinks they did did I think that was part of the whole thing where do where do you think where do you think that line is like you know should PE should everyone do one iasa trip or if you do if you do an iasa trip a year is that I don't everyone has to do anything and I think everyone has their own requirements and I think um I think as you do that everything like this especially psychedelics one of the more disappointing things recently was that the FDA had denied um they they did these MDMA trials for you know about all this yep yeah very very disappointing um that they wanted to make MDMA therapy available to Veterans and people with severe PTSD and it has extreme benefits clinical benefits known documented benefits and for whatever reason the FDA decided that they have to go through a whole new series of Trials to tr try to get this stuff legalized which is very disappointing and yeah I I I I was I was very bullish on the stuff happening um and the way I thought about it four or five years ago was um that um it was a hack to doing a double blind study and because the FDA always has this concept that you need to do a double blind study you give one one you know onethird of the people you give a sugar pill and two-thirds you give the real drug and you have to and no one knows whether they have the sugar pill or the real drug and then um and then you see how it works works and science requires a double blind study and then my my anti- double blind study theory is if if it really works you don't need a double blind study it should just work and there's something sociopathic about doing double blind studies because one third of the people who have this bad disease are getting a sugar pill and we we shouldn't even be like maybe it's um immoral to do double blind studies studies on unique and novel things make sense um this is not unique nor novel it's been around a long well unique yes but well my my claim is if it's if it's a um uh if it actually works you shouldn't need to do a double blind study at all but um and then my Hope was that um MDMA psychedelics all these things they were a hack on the double blind study because um you knew whether you got the real thing or the sugar pill and so this would be a way to um to hack through this ridiculous double blind Criterion and just get the study done and then what I what I think um part part of it it's probably just an anti-drug ideology by the FDA but um but the other part that happened on the sort of science scientific establishment level is they think you need a double blind study Joe we know you're hacking this double blind study because people will know whether they got the sugar pill or not and that's why we're going to arbitrarily change the goal posts and set them at way way harder because we know there's no way you can do a double blind study and if it's not a double blind study it's no good because that's what our ideology of science tells us and um and that's sort of that's sort of what I think was part of part of what went um sort of politically Haywire with this stuff well I also think that it's Pandora's Box I think that's a real issue and that if uh they do find extreme benefit in using MDMA therapy particularly for veterans if they start doing and it starts becoming very effective and it becomes well known and widespread then it will open up the door to all these other psychedelic compounds and I think that's a real threat to the powers that be it's a real threat to the establishment if you have people thinking in a completely alternative way and mean we saw what happened during the 1960s and that's one of the reasons why they threw water on everything and had it become schedule one and locked the country down in terms of the the access to psychedelics all that stuff happened out of a reaction to the way society and culture was changing in the 1960s if that happened today it would throw a giant monkey wrench in our political system in our cultural system the way we govern the way we just the way allocation of resources all that would change if I if I if I just to articulate the alternate version on this um there's always a you know there's there's a part um let me think how to how to get this um you know there's there's one there's a question whether um this the shift to interiority um is it a compliment or a substitute like what I said about talk and action is it a compliment or a substitute to changing the outside world so we focus on changing ourselves is this the first step to changing the world or is it um is it sort of a hypnotic way in which our attention is being redirected to from outer space to interner space so I don't know the one liner I had years ago was um you know we landed on the moon in July of 1969 and three weeks later Woodstock started and that's when the hippies took over the country and um and you know and um we stopped going to outer space because we started going to Inner Space and that's and so there's sort of a question um you know how much the you know um it it it worked as a um as an activator or as a or as a a deactivator in a way um and uh you know there are all these different modalities of interiority there's psychological therapy there's meditation there's yoga there's um you know there was a sexual Revolution there were gradually you have incels living in their parents basement playing video games so they all you know there's um the naval gazing that is identity politics um there's a range of psychedelic things and um and I think all of these things um I I I wonder whether the interiority ended up acting as a as a substitute because you know the alternate history in the 1960s is that um you know the hippies were actually they were anti-political and uh it was it was sort of that the the the drugs happened at the end of the city at the end of the 60s and that's when people depoliticized you it was like I don't know the beatle s you're carrying around pictures of shairon ma you're not going to make with anyone anyhow it's like that's after they did LSD it was just the sort of insane politics no longer matters and so you have the Civil Rights the Vietnam War and then were the drugs the thing that motivated it or was that was that the thing where it actually um those those things started to started to deescalate I think they were happening at the same time and I think the Vietnam war coinciding with the psychedelic drug movement in the 1960s it was one of the reasons why it was so dangerous to The Establishment CU these people were far less likely to buy into this idea that they needed to fly to Vietnam and go kill people they didn't know and they were far less likely to support any war and I think there was this sort of bizarre movement that we had never seen before this flower children move that we know that they plotted against I mean if you read chaos uh by Tom O'Neal familiar with fantastic book that shows you what they were trying to do to demonize these these hippies well was or or or the the part of it that I thought was interesting was the MK Ultra yeah which part of it where um you know we uh there was a a predecessor version where uh we thought of um you know there was a you could think of it as we had an arms race with f the fascists and the Communists and they were very good at brainwashing people the gobl propaganda North Koreans brainwashing our soldiers in the Korean War um our PS and uh we needed to have an arms race to program and reprogram and deprogram people and um LSD was uh was was sort of the MK ultra shortcut so I think I think there was and then I yeah my so hard to reconstruct it but uh my my suspicion is that the MK Ultra thing was was a lot bigger than than we realize and that uh you know it was it was the LSD movement both in the Harvard form and the Stanford form you know it started it started as an MK Ultra project Timothy liry at Harvard um Ken keesy at Stanford you know I knew uh Tom Wolf the um American novelist I still think his greatest novel was uh um the Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test which is sort of this history of the LSD counterculture movement starts at Stanford moves the hate Ashbury and San Francisco and uh but it starts with Ken key a grad student at Stanford like I Circa 1958 and um you get an extra $75 a day if you go to the Meno Park veterans hospital and um they give you some random drug and um yeah he got extra $75 a grad student in English um doing LSD and um Tom Wolf writes this you know iconic uh fictionalized novel very realistic 1968 about this and um wolf could not have imagined that the whole thing started as some CIA mind control project right the menal park veterans hospital that was deep State adjacent sure well ha ashbery free clinic run by the CIA sure that's even crazier the whole thing's crazy Jolly Jolly West guy y yeah the the whole thing's crazy which leads me to what do you think they're doing today if they were doing that then I do not believe that they abandoned this idea of programming people I do not believe that I don't think they would because I know it's effective look people join Cults every day we're well aware that people can be ideologically captured we're well aware we're well aware people will buy into crazy ideas as long as it's supported by whatever Community they associate with that's a just a natural aspect of being a human being maybe it's part of what you were saying this imitation thing that we have it leads us to do this if they have that knowledge and that understanding that for sure they're probably doing things similar today which is one of the things that I think about a lot when I think about this guy that tried to shoot Trump I I want to know what happened and I don't think we're getting a very detailed explanation at all as to how this person achieved these the get how he they got on the roof how they got to that position how they trained what who were they in contact with who was teaching them why did they why did they do it what was going on we we are in the dark and I wonder like you know that was always The Manchurian Candidate idea right this idea that we trained assassins and was the RFK uh dad um assassination 196 s where um he again maybe shouldn't believe him but he claimed that uh he didn't even know what he was doing it was on some hypnotic trance or whatever and it was like it was like the assassin in The Manchurian Candidate yeah yeah I mean that is possible I don't know if he's telling the truth he could have just had a psychotic break who knows obviously also convenient yeah very convenient but it's a possibility that she could be should be considered I mean I this Crooks kid that did this that shot at the president what how what happened I want to know what happened man I I don't I I probably Veer in the direction that there were you know on the on the sort of conspiracy theory of History I Veer in the direction that there was a lot of crazy stuff like this that was going on in the US first half of the 20th century overdrive 1940s you I mean you had the Manhattan Project there's this giant secret project uh 1950 s 1960s and then um and then somehow the last 50 years I think the I'm not sure disturbing uh P but the perspective I have is these institutions are less functional I I don't think um I don't think the CIA is doing anything quite like MK Ultra anymore um why do you think that I think you had the church commission hearings in the late 70s and uh and somehow things things got things got exposed and um and then um when when things when a bureaucracy is forced to be formalized um it probably becomes a lot less functional you know um there was a like the 2000s version there was I think there was a lot of crazy stuff that we did in Black sites torturing people um that the CIA ran you know in the war on terror uh water boarding there's all sorts of batshit crazy stuff that happened but then um you know once John Yu in the bush 43 Administration writes the torture memos and sort of formalizes this is how many times you can water dunk someone without it being torture etc etc once you formalize it people somehow know that it's on its way out because you know um it doesn't quite work anymore so by I don't know by 2007 um at Guantanamo I think the inmates were running the Asylum the inmates and the defense lawyers were running it you were way safer as a Muslim terrorist in Guantanamo than as a let's say suspected cop killer in Manhattan there was still an informal process in Manhattan you were suspected cop killer they'd figure out some way to um to deal with you out inside the judicial the formal judicial process um and um but I think something there was a sort of formalization that happened there was the post uh J Edgar Hoover FBI where Hoover was I don't know a law unto himself it was completely out of control CIA even more so and then um you know once it all gets exposed and uh um it it probably is a lot harder to do the NSA you know NSA probably held up longer as a deep State entity where it at least had the virtue people you know I think the 1980s it was still referred to as no such agency so it's still it was still far more obscure so the necessary condition is that if some part of the deep State's doing it you know we we we can barely know what's going on right with them and then I don't know you know the the 2000s 2010s history on the on on you know I think the Patriot Act empowered all these fisa courts and I think there was I think there probably um were ways the NSA fisa court process was was weaponized in a really really crazy way um and you know it culminated in in 2016 with all the um you know the crazy Russia conspiracy theories against Trump um but I I think even that I I'm not sure they can do anymore because it got exposed can't do that anymore but a small program that is top secret that is designed under the opes of protecting American lives extracting information from people I'm I'm I'm agreeing with you the the NSA fisa court process is is one where you had a pretty out ofc Control process from let's say Circa I don't know 2003 to 2017 2018 so that's relatively recent history mhm um I don't know you know they're all the they're all the Jeffrey Epstein conspiracy theories uh which um I'm probably too fascinated by um because it felt like there was there was some crazy stuff going on that they were able to cover up and still are uh and then but then man doesn't it the fact that we're still talking about Jeffrey Epstein tell us um how hard it is to come up with anything else no because there's no answers for the Jeffrey Epstein thing there's been no consequences other than glain Maxwell going to jail and Jeffrey Epstein allegedly committing suicide which I don't think he did other than that what are the consequences they they they were able to pull off this thing this some some sort of operation what you know who knows who was behind it who knows what was the motivation but it clearly has something to do with compromising people which is an age-old strategy for getting people to do what you want them to do you have things on them you use those things as leverage and then next thing you know you've got people saying things that you want them to say do and and it motivate moves policy changes things get things done that they did that yes and no one and we know they did that and yet no one is asking for the tapes no one's asking asking for the The Client List we we're in the dark still and probably I don't know man I I I spend too much time thinking about all all the all the Epstein variants it pro probably probably the sex stuff is overdone and everything else is underdone it's like with it's like a limited hangout we get to talk about the crazy underage sex and um and you know not about all all the other questions it's like when Alex aosta testified for labor secretary under and he was he was the da who prosecuted Epstein in ' 0809 and um got him sort of the very light 13-month or whatever uh sentence and um was it South Florida da or whatever he was um and and uh aosta was asked you know um uh you know why did why did he get off so easily and and under Congressional testimony when he's up for labor secretary 2017 it was um he belonged to intelligence that's yeah and then and then you know um and so it's yeah it's it's it the question isn't about the sex with the underage women the question is is really about you know why was he why was he so protected and then you know I I went I I went down all these rabbit holes was he you know working for the Israelis or the Mad Or all all this sort of stuff and uh I've come to think that that's that was very secondary it was obviously it was just the US you know you know if you're working for Israel you don't get protected you we had Jonathan Paul he went to jail for 25 years or whatever um and um but unrelated right understood but it's but it's uh but this is one particular operation But but so it's but it it was uh if if it was an intelligence operation the question we should be asking is what part of the US intelligence right system was was he working for was he working for you know but don't you think that's an effective strategy for controlling politicians getting them involved in sex scandals I mean that's always been one of the the worst things that can happen to a politician look at Monica Lewinsky a very simple one consensual inappropriate sexual relationship between a president and a staffer and it almost takes down the presidency it causes him to get impeached uh powerful motivators the shame of it all also the illegal activity the fact that it's I mean it's one of the most disgusting things that we think of with people having sex with underage people um I'm I'm I'm I'm sure that was part of it I suspect there are a lot of other questions that uh you know one one one should one should also most certainly but I would think that that is one of the best motivators that we have is having dirt on people like that especially something that could ruin your career especially people that are deeply embedded in this system of people knowing things about people and using those at their advant I mean that's an age-old strategy in politics that was Jay Edgar Hoover's entire modus Opera my my my my Riff on it was always that it was um it was it's it's a little bit different from the J Edgar Hoover thing and the question was always whether the people doing it knew they were getting compromised and so it's it's it's it it's the vibe is not that um um um you somehow got compromised it was more you were joining this uh this secret Club you got to be made you're a made man in the mafia and you get to do crazy things no no no no it's only if we have comprom mod on you do you get ahead right it's like you know it's like I don't know it's one of these uh um yeah closet of the vaan the claim is 80% of the Cardinals in the Catholic church are gay not sure if that's true but uh directionally it's probably correct and the the basic thesis is you don't get promoted to a cardinal if you're straight because um we need to have and so we need you need to be compromised and then you're under control um but you also get ahead completely makes sense completely makes sense in the way to do that with especially the all these politicians who are essentially like Bad actors a lot of them they're just people that want power and people that want control a lot of them and you know those kind of guys they want a party you know I mean that has been you've got two types of uh leaders that are presidents you got [ __ ] hounds and warmongers you know and you know some of sometimes you have both but generally you don't you guys like Clinton and JFK were anti-war and then you have guys like uh Bush who you don't think of at all as a [ __ ] Hound but most certainly you think of as a warmonger hm do you what what um what do you do you have a theory on what was Bill Gates's complicity with Epstein I think he likes [ __ ] I think I think he's a man I think he likes power he likes Monopoly I mean he's incredibly effective with Microsoft and for the longest time he was thought of as a villain right he was this antitrust villain he was this guy who was monopolizing this operating system and and and controlling just this incredible Empire and he had a real bad rap and then I think he wisely turned towards philanthropy and uh but do you do you do you think do you think that he needed Epstein I think it's very difficult a very famous very high-profile person to [ __ ] around I think it's very difficult I think you have to worry about people telling people you worry about it taking you down if you're having Affairs if you're running some pH philanthropy organization you're supposed to be thought of as this guy who's like this one wonderful person who's trying to really fix all the problems in the world but really he just flying around and and banging all these different chicks you have to figure out a way to pull that off and this is what uh Eric Weinstein and I we've had discussions about this and Eric's position is that there are people in this world that can provide experiences for you and safely for people that are in that kind of a group and that makes sense it makes sense that if you pay people enough and you have people motivated in order to like establish these relationships and make sure that these things happen when you get very high-profile you can't just be on a [ __ ] dating app and if you're a guy who likes to bank checks what are you going to do I the um all of that might be true but I I I wonder if there are more straightforward alternate conspiracy theories on Epstein that we're missing so let me do let me do alternate one on Bill Gates where um the um you know the things just just looking at what's hiding in plain sight um you know he supposedly um talked to um Epstein early on about um how his marriage wasn't doing that well and then Epstein suggested that he should get a divorce Circa 2010 2011 and Gates told him something like um you know um uh that doesn't quite work um didn't have presumably because he didn't have a prenup so um so there's one part of Epstein as a marriage counselor which is sort of disturbing um but then um the second thing that we know that um that Gates talked to to Epstein about was um sort of uh you know all the sort of collaborating on funding setting up this philanthropy all this sort of this um somewhat corrupt left-wing philanthropy structures and so there's a question you know um um does and then and then my sort of straightforward alternate conspiracy theory is um should we ask um should we ask should we combine those two and uh was there was there you know and I I don't have all the details in this figured out but it would be something like you know um Bill and Melinda get married in 1994 they don't sign a prup um and you know something's going wrong with the marriage and maybe Melinda can get half the money in a in a divorce he doesn't want her to get half the money what do you do and um uh and then the alternate plan is something like um you set up you set up uh you commit the marital assets to this nonprofit and um and then it it sort of locks Melinda into not complaining about the marriage for a long long time and it's and and it's it's some kind of a um and and so there's something about the left-wing philanthropy world that was uh it was sort of some sort of Boomer way to control their crazy wives or something like this it's also an effective way to whiteash your your past right your thought there all these and he he talked to Epstein about he got Epstein to meet with the uh the head of the Nobel Prize foundation so it was um yeah Bill Gates wanted to get a Nobel Nobel Prize wow right so this is all this is all yeah this is all straightforward this is all known yeah and and and I'm not saying what you're saying about do you know the history of the Nobel Prize that's the ultimate whitewash sure it was preventing Dynamite yeah that's the he was he well Peter Berg told me the story I was blown away he originally um they act someone said that he died and it was printed that he died but he didn't die and in the stories they were calling him The Merchant of death cuz he was the guy that invented dynamite and he re realized that oh my God I this is my reputation this is how think people think about me I have to do something to turn this around so he invented the Nobel Prize and he started then now the the name Nobel is automatically connected in most people's eyes to the the greatest people amongst us the people that have contributed the most to society and science and art and peace and all these different things Nobel Prize for medicine the guy who invented super crazy history yeah it's a crazy history but it's the ultimate whitewash it's the same thing like he came up with that prize because he wanted to change his image publicly and um so it's ironic that Bill Gates would want to get a Nobel Prize um or not iron or ironic but understandable and ironic but but I think but then if we if we uh if and so there's yeah so there's there's underage sex version of the Epstein story and then there is a crazy status Nobel Prize history of it and there is a corrupt leftwing philanthropy one and there is a uh Boomers who didn't sign um prenuptual agreements with their their wives story right and um and and I think all those are worth exploring more I think you're right what is what about the these leftwing philanthropy Ventures do you think is uniquely corrupt um sorry which one do I think is most corrupt or what what about them these when when you said corrupt yeah well um man it's it's there's something about it's maybe it's just my hermeneutic of Suspicion but there's something about you know there's something about the virtue signaling and what does it mean and I always think this is sort of a Europe America versus Europe difference where in um America we're told that um um that philanthropy is something a good person does and um you know if you're a Rockefeller or and you start giving away all your money um this is just this is just what um a good person does and it shows how good you are and then I think sort of the European intuition on it is something like um you know wow um that's it's only something a very evil person does and if you if you start giving away all your money in Europe it's like Joe you must have murdered somebody or you must you must be covering up for something so there these two very different intuitions and I think I think the European one is more correct than the American one and uh probably there's some history where um you know the sort of left-wing philanthropy peaked in 2007 2010 2012 and there's these subtle ways you know we've um we've become you know we've become more you know more more um more European in our sensibilities as a society and so it has this very different veence from what it did uh 12 or 14 years ago but yeah it's all we we ask all these questions like we're asking right now about Bill Gates where it's like okay he was you know it was like all the testimony in the Microsoft antitrust trial in the 90s where he's like he's cutting off the air supply he wants to strangle people and he's like not he's kind of a sociopathic guy it seems and then it's it's it's this giant whitewashing operation and and then somehow the whitewashing has been made too transparent and uh it gets deconstructed and exposed by you know the internet or whatever but I think most people are still unaware of how much whitewashing actually took place including donating somewhere in the neighborhood of 300 plus million dollars to Media corporations essentially buying favorable uh reviews about him and then there's this very public philanthropy it's not just philanthropy it's philanthropy mixed with public relations public Rel um relations because he's constantly doing interviews about it this is not like a guy who is just silently donating his incredible wealth to all these causes he's advocating for it on various talk shows he's constantly talking about it and how we need to do things I mean during the pandemic he was a very vocal voice he was the guy telling us he was a somehow or another he became a public health expert and no one questioned why we were taking Public Health advice from some someone who has a financial interest in this one very particular remedy yeah or um yeah there all these alternate versions I can give but yeah I I think um I think uh it's so it's always so hard to know what's really going on in our culture though so I I think I think all what you say is true but I also think it's not working as well as it used to Ag and there's a way people see through this it's not always as articulate as you just articulated it but there's there's some there's some vague intuition that um you know um you know when Mr Gates is just wearing uh sweaters and looks like Mr Rogers that something fishy is going on people people have that sort of in trust Jeff Bezos in his tight shirt hanging out with his girlfriend on the yach or Elon Elon Musk uh the vi signaling is safer than virtue signaling yeah right because if you're you know if your virtue signaling are intuition is something really really really sketchy suspicious we get suspicious and I think rightly so I think especially when someone's doing something so public I think rightly we should be suspicious especially when I mean with with Gates it's like you know the history of the guy I mean you know what he was involved with before you know how he ran Microsoft you know it just kind of makes sense that it's a clever movie move it's a clever move to pay the media it's a clever move again my my my my alternate one which is not incompatible with yours on on on Gates is that uh um Melinda finally files for divorce in early 21 um I think she told Bill she wanted one late 2019 so 2020 the year where um he Bill Gates goes into overdrive on covid um you know um all this stuff you know part part of it maybe it's self-dealing and he's trying to make money from the drug company or something like this but um you know isn't isn't the other really big thing he needs to box Melinda in and force her not to get that much out because all the money's going to the foundation anyway Melinda has to say um you know um I want why do you want half the money it's all going to the Gates Foundation anyway we're not leaving our kids anything and um and then when you lean into Co you know how does that work in the you know it's somehow um in theory Melinda has a really strong hand she should get half that's what you get in a divorce with um no prenuptial but then if you make it go overdrive on Co Melinda are you a you know are you a I don't know uh are you like some crazy anti-science person right and um and so so I don't know my my my my my my reconstruction is that uh you should not underestimate how much of it was you know about just controlling his ex-wife and and not about controlling the whole society makes sense it makes sense you they can both be they can both be correct sure there there's many factors but mine mine lines up really well with the with the timeline well we're probably talking about a hundred million doll or hundred billion dollars one way or the other well I think she got got she got less than she got like one tenth really interesting and she should have gotten half as far as and I it's amazing he got it down that much WoW interesting but it was just I think she was just boxed in every time he went on TV talking about Co she was boxed in with all of her leftwing friends that is an interesting philosophy that's an interesting way to approach a problem if you're him very wise you know very clever I mean if you're just looking at like just for personal benefit the genius move and the guy's a genius clearly brilliant guy you know I mean that makes sense makes sense that he would do that I don't know you know I would do that probably should have had a prup but yeah yeah well that's kind of crazy that's interesting that yeah I didn't consider that but it makes sense and she's you know she's been kind of pretty vocal unfortunately for him about his ties to Epstein being one of the primary reasons why she wanted out but again my Al again it's what did he was he was he was he having extramarital Affairs through Epstein or maybe Epstein was from Melinda's point of view would it be worse for Epstein to facilitate an extramarital affair or would it be worse for Epstein to be advising Gates on how to how to ditch Melinda without giving her any money what do you think he was that would be much much worse from a Linda's point of view yeah makes sense it totally makes sense do you think that he was a legitimate finan adviser like he could give him advice on how to do those things that Gates wouldn't have more effective people I mean he's when you're at that level of wealth I'm sure you have wealth management people that are like very high level um because that's one of the things that Eric said about him he said when he met him he's like this guy's a fraud like this he doesn't know enough about what he's talking about and you know Eric is you know I I I met Epstein a a few times as well and I think how'd you get introduced um it was uh it was Reed Hoffman and Silicon Valley introduced us in 2014 but um but it was it was basically uh and I I you know I didn't didn't uh check didn't ask any enough questions about it um but I yeah I I think there were sort of a lot of things where it was was fraudulent I do think Epstein knew a lot about taxes and um and there were probably you know these these complicated ways you could um you could structure a nonprofit organization especially as a way in in a in a marital cont context that uh that I I think Epstein might have might have known a decent amount about how when you were introduced to him I don't I don't think Epstein would have been able to um you know comment on super String Theory something like that but uh but I think I think this sort of thing he he might have actually been pretty expert on when you were introduced to him what how was he described to you um he was described as uh one of the smartest tax people in the world interesting and uh and I I probably probably was my moral weakness that I how could you have known back then he had never been arrested no this was this was post 2014 was post arrest oh so his arrest was the first arrest right which was like 200 78 okay okay and so but you know you you assume um he didn't go to jail for that long right it was probably not not as serious as alleged uh there was was certainly was the illusion that there were all these these other people that I trusted you know Reed who introduced us was you know he started LinkedIn he was you know maybe too focused on business Network working but but uh but I thought he always had good judgment in people when the [ __ ] went down and epine gets arrested for the second time were you like oh well there you go uh I've thought about it I thought a lot about it as a result yeah yeah I'm sure Jesus Christ well he tricked a lot of people I know a lot of people that met that guy he got a lot of celebrities to come to his house for parties and things well I think I think it was it's it was it's a I think a lot of it was this was this strange commentary on you know I know it was some secret Club secret society you could be part of right of course again that wasn't it wasn't explicit but that was that was the vague vague Vibe of the whole thing people love those stupid things they love like exclusive clubs that very few people look at the [ __ ] Soho House like look at that stupid thing I mean you just go to a place that you have to be a member to go to and everybody wants to be a member oh my God got get and then you got like the Malibu Soho house it's different from the other ones you have to have membership only there do you have membership there people love that kind of [ __ ] socially they love being a part of a Walled Garden they love it they love it and if you're a guy like Bill Gates or or or similarly wealthy you probably have a very small amount of people that you can relate to very small amount of people that you can trust probably very difficult to form new friendships yeah I I I think there were probably different different things that were pitched for different people sure you know I I was I was pitched on the taxes I think you know there were probably other people that were you know more um more prone to the you know um the Social Club part and then there were probably people yeah and there was probably a fairly limited group where it was uh yeah off off the charts bad wouldn't it be wonderful to know what the [ __ ] was really going on and maybe one day we will maybe one day some Whitney web type character will break it all down to us and explain do us in great detail exactly how this was formulated and what they were doing and how they were getting information out of people but I think people have to age out they have to they have to die and we we still don't have it on the Kennedy assassination JFK crazy well one of the wildest Things That Trump said was that if they told you what they told me you wouldn't tell people either which is like what the [ __ ] does that mean what does that mean I don't think legally he can tell you right because I think those things are Above Top Secret if if they did inform him of something there must be some sort of prerequisite to keeping this a secret I I I haven't studied that one that carefully but isn't you know there all these alternate conspiracy theories on who killed JFK it's you know the CIA and the mafia and the Russians and the Cubans and um you know um there's an LBJ version since he's the one who benefited so all these happened in Texas um uh you have all these you know alternate theories and on some level it's it's it's yeah it's it's I always think it's just a commentary where you know 1963 America wasn't it wasn't like Leave it to Beaver it was it was like a really crazy country underneath the surface and absolutely um and even though probably most of the conspiracy theories are wrong it was like murder on the oran Express and all these people sort of had different reasons for wanting Kennedy dead and that's that's what the theories are right even if they're wrong on the level of factual detail and then the the the sort of more minimal one that I'm I'm open to and I think there's some evidence in this from from the stuff that has been that has uh come out is you know Oswald was talking to you know parts of the US deep State and so even if Oswald was the Lan assassin and you somehow get the magic bullet theory and all that stuff to work but let's say Oswald was the loan ass pass did did he did he tell someone in the FBI or CIA you know I'm going to I'm going to go kill Kennedy tomorrow and then you know maybe maybe the CIA didn't have to kill him they just didn't had to do nothing just had a sit on it or or maybe was too incompetent and didn't get you know didn't go up the bureaucracy and so it's you know I I think we sort of know that they they talked to Oswald you know a fair amount before before it happened and uh and so there's at least something you know that was grossly incompetent I think people have a problem minimum with with two stories being mut mutually exclusive two stories being the lone gunman or the CIA killed Kennedy and then they these they're not connected I think Lee Harvey Oswell was a part of it I think I think he probably did shoot that cop there's some evidence that you when when he was on the run and he was confronted you know there was a cop that that got shot and were alleging he he he might have done it he might have taken a shot at Kennedy he might have even hit him I don't think he was the only one shooting I I think the the vast there was an enormous amount of people that heard sounds coming from the grassy null they heard gunfire they reportedly saw people the amount of people that were witnesses to the Kennedy assassination that died mysterious deaths is pretty shocking um Jack Ruby Well Jack Ruby just that's a weird one right Oswald yeah Jack Ruby walks up to Oswald shoots him and then Jack Ruby with no previous history of mental illness becomes completely insane after getting visited by Jolly West which is nuts like why is the guy who's the head of MK Ultra visiting the guy who shot the Assassin of the president and why is he left alone with them what what happens what does he give him that this guy is screaming out they're burning Jews alive and just crazy crazy [ __ ] he was yelling out he went nuts probably some some amount of usty that dangerous enormous amount they probably gave him a [ __ ] glass of it they probably gave him a glass of it and told him it was water drink this and who [ __ ] knows but the point is I think I think it's very possible that Oswald was a part of it and the way they did it and the way they just shot Oswald and and then they write the warrant commission we don't even see the zuder film until 12 years later when haraldo Rivera and when they play it on television when um Dick Gregory brought it to Heraldo Rivera which is wild a comedian brings the video the the the actual film rather of the assassination from a different angle well you can actually see the video of him getting shot and his his head snaps back and to the left and everybody's like what the [ __ ] is going on here um when you look at all that stuff this mirrors what happened with this Crooks kid this Crooks kid somehow or another gets to the top of the roof is spotted by these people they know he's there they know he has a rifle they see him walking around the crime scene half an hour before with a rangefinder the the whole thing is bananas and then they go to his house after he's killed it's completely scrubbed there's no silverware there they know that there's ad data that shows that a phone that's coming from the FBI offices in DC had visited him on multiple occasions cuz they tracked ad data there's and if that guy if he shot Trump and Trump got murdered and then they shot him it would be the Kennedy assassination all over again everybody would going what the [ __ ] happened what happened what was the motivation what was he on any drugs what's the toxicology report how did he get up there who knew he was up there how how did they not shoot him quicker like what the [ __ ] happened how was he able to get off three shots what happened and go I I think there's like a slightly less crazy that might still be true which is just that uh people in the Secret Service in the um Biden Administration don't like Trump and it's they didn't have full intention to kill him but it's just they didn't protect him we're just we're just you know we're going to have we're going to underst staff it we're um we're not going to we don't have to do as good a job coordinating with the local police there's all these ways you know um to make someone less safe you know but it seems more than that if they if they knew that the guy was on the roof with a rifle that seems a little more than that it's always a question who they is though right well if I'm a sniper and I'm on people people in the audience people there were people there tell telling it to people right but I think the authorities knew this guy was on the roof before as well um well I I I I suspect some of the Secret Service people were were told that and then who knows how that got relayed or who all snipers already have eye on him I believe the snipers already had eye on I I don't know find out if that's true Jamie find out the snipers had eye on SEC service I don't know about the snipers I I I I I don't I don't know about uh the the thing I don't have a good sense on with uh with with with shooting and maybe maybe you'd have a better feel for this is my my senses was a pretty straightforward shot for for the guy in um the Trump assassin would be assassin I think the Oswalt shot was a much harder one because Kennedy's moving yes and no yes and no okay because uh Oswald had a scope so Oswald had a rifle the marono rifle say one of the snipers stationed inside the building reported first saw Crooks outside and looking up to the roof of the building before the suspect left the scene Crooks Slater came back and sat down while looking at his phone near the building CBS News reported that a sniper took a photo of the suspect when he returned but I think they saw him on the roof though um Crooks then took out a rang finder like right then arrest that guy you got a [ __ ] Rangefinder about the suspect's action Crooks then disappeared again and returned to the building with a backpack again arrest him Secret Service snipers again alerted their command post about Crook's actions according to the source who spoke with CBS News Crooks had already climbed to the top of the building in question by the time the additional officers arrived at the scene for backup the suspect also positioned himself above and behind the snipers inside the building by the time the police started rushing the scene and other officers attempted to get onto the roof the source told CBS news that a different Secret Service sniper had killed Crooks okay so it seems like they they [ __ ] bumbled it at every step of the way if they knew that guy was there if they knew he had a rangef finder returns to the backpack he gets onto the roof all that's insane that is at the very least horrific incompetence at the very least let me go back yeah okay but back to Mike was it I I thought it was a much easier shot for it's not an easy head shot um he's shooting at his head but why why why why was shooting at the head the right thing shouldn't you be shooting at well you don't know if he's wearing a vest right um he could be wearing a vest which you would have to have plates you'd have to have uh ceramic plates in order to stop a a a rifle round so was was it a 308 what what did he have what kind of rifle did he have I have never seen that I think he had an AR-15 so and are are the Scopes a lot better today than he have we're pretty sure how good was Oswell scope it was good they said it was off this was one of the the conspiracy theories uh oh the scope was off but that doesn't mean anything because Scopes can get off when you pick it up if you knock it against the wall when he drops it if you makes the shot and then drops the scope and the scope hits the window sill and then bounces off that's excuse me that Scopes off anytime you knock is there anything about the high angle from Oswald made it harder no not a difficult shot very difficult to get off three shots very quickly so that was the thing that they had attributed three shots to Oswald the reason why they had attributed three shots is because one of them had hit a Ricochet one of them had gone into the underpass ricocheted off the curb and hit a man who was treated at a hospital they found that they found out where had hit the bulleted hit so they knew that one bullet Miss Kennedy hit that curb which would have indicated that someone shot from a similar position as Lee Harvey Oswell um so then they had the one wound that uh Kennedy had to the head of course and then they had another wound that Kennedy had uh through his neck that's the magic bullet theory this is why they had to come up with the magic bullet theory cuz they had tribute all these wounds to one bullet then they find this pristine bullet they find it in the gurnie when they're bringing uh Governor Connelly in nonsense it's total nonsense the bullet is undeformed a bullet that goes through two people and leaves more fragments of the bullet in Connelly's wrist that are missing from the bullet itself and then the bullets not deformed after shattering bone all that's crazy all that defies logic that doesn't make any sense if you know anything about bullets and if you shoot bullets into things they distort it's just one of the things that happen um that bullet looks like someone shot it into a swimming pool that's what it looks like when they would do ballistics on on bullets and they try to figure out like if it was this guy's gun or that guy's gun and by the rifling of the round they can get similar markings on bullets when they do that that's how they do it they do it so the Bullet doesn't distort so they shoot that bullet into uh water or something like that now that bullet was uh metal jacketed right if you look at the bullet the top of it is uh [ __ ] up and but the the shape of the bullet looks pretty perfect it doesn't look like something that shattered bones and then you have to attribute you have to account rather for the amount of per there's little fragments of the bullet that you could see that they found in Connelly's wrist the whole thing's nuts the whole thing's nuts that you're only saying that this one guy did it because that's convenient and the Warren commission's the Warren Commission whitewashed everything so the whole thing's nuts it's much more likely that there were people in the grassy null and then the umbrellas as the pointers or whatever I mean I don't know I don't know about what all I know is you got a guy in a convertible which is [ __ ] crazy who is the president of the United States and he's going slowly down a road now if you are in a prone position so Oswald is uh on the window sill right which is a great place to shoot by the way it's a great place to shoot cuz you rest that gun on the window sill and if you rest it on the window sill there's no movement right so you wrap your arm around the sling if it had a sling I'm not sure if it did so you get a nice tight grip you shove it up against your shoulder you rest it on the window sill and all you have to do is you have a round already racked all and you have a scope and so the scope's magnified all you have to do is wait until he's there you lead him just a little bit and squeeze one off and then boom boom you could do that pretty quick it's not outside of the realm of possibility that he did get off three shots what doesn't make sense is the backing to the left it doesn't make sense that all these other people saw people shooting from the grassy null there's all these people that saw people running away they saw smoke there's smoke in some photographs of it it looks like there was more than one shooter and it looks like they tried to they tried to hide that they tried to hide that in the warrant commission report the shot to Kennedy's neck initially was in when they brought him in in Dallas when he was before they shipped him to Bethesda they said that that was an entry wound when he got to Bethesda then it became a tracheotomy why do you give a tracheotomy to a guy who doesn't have a head you don't I mean that just none of it makes any sense they altered the autopsy this is a part of David lon's book best evidence um Kennedy's brain wasn't even in his body when they buried him like the the the whole thing is very strange but then do do you get to anything more concrete than my murder on the orian express where they're just you know it could have been a lot of people could the Russians the Cubans the well no one even got suspicious for 12 years I think people were susp a lot of people suspicious kind of but what do you have to go on you don't have to go on anything like this Crooks kid we don't have anything to go on we're just going to be left out here just like we're left out here with the the Epstein information no one knows the people that whoever organized it if anyone did you're never going to hear about it it's just going to go away the news Cycle's just going to keep flooded with more nonsense and and I think there's probably a bunch of people that wanted Kennedy dead I think there was more than one group of people that wanted Kennedy dead I think there's probably collusion between groups that wanted Kennedy dead and I think there's a lot of people that have vested interest in ending his presidency and I think he was dangerous he was dangerous to a lot of the powers it be he was dangerous his his famous speech about secret societies crazy speech guy has this speech and then gets murdered right afterwards kind of nuts like the whole thing's nuts he wanted to get rid of the CIA he wanted to I mean there was so many things that Kennedy wanted to do there were also a lot of crazy things Kennedy was doing you know so you know the um the the Cuba version of the assassination theory was um you know we had the Cuban Missile Crisis in 62 about a year earlier and then the deal that we struck with the Soviets was um you know um they take the missiles out of Cuba and we promised we wouldn't um we wouldn't try to overthrow the government in Cuba and uh and I guess we you know we no longer did um you know we no longer did Bay of Pigs type covert stuff like that but I think there were still something like four or five assassination plots on Fidel yeah attempts actual attempts and then I think there was I don't know I think that again I'm going to get this garbled I think a month or two before the JFK assassination it castra said something like you know um there might be repercussions if you keep doing this yeah well listen I'm sure there's a lot of people that wanted that guy dead and I'm sure they would coordinate I mean if you knew that Cuba wanted Kennedy dead and you knew that Cuba can get you assassins or that they could help in in any way you I'm sure they would want as many people that knew for a fact they wanted him dead and had communicated that I mean back then they were doing wild [ __ ] man I mean this is when they were doing operation Northwood this again where I think I think I think it is I don't think we're in a world where zero stuff is happening I I still I still uh the place where I directionally have a different feel for it is I think um so much less of the stuff is going on and it's it's so much harder in this internet world for people to hide with whistleblowers as well and their legacy programs and there are internal records that are being kept and um you know like I I I don't know this for sure but I think even the NSA fisa court stuff which was an outof control deep State thing that was going on through about 2016 2017 I suspect even that at this point you know can't quite work because people know that they're being watched they know they're being recorded and it's it's just you know you know you can't do water boarding in Guantanamo if you have lawyers running all over the place correct and that's I hope you're correct but it brings me back to this whole idea of getting dirt then I think I think there's and then on the other hand there's also um you know a degree to which um our government our our deep State um across the board is shockingly less competent less functional and um it's less capable of this and this is this is where I'm not even sure whether this is an improvement you know right so it's it's sort of like um you know um maybe um the 1963 us where let's go with the craziest version where our deep state is capable of knocking off the president maybe that's actually a higher functioning Society than uh than the uh than um the crazy version where they are they're incapable of doing it right and they're bogged down with Dei they can't they they can't they can't get the gunman even to have a scope on his rifle or whatever yeah I don't we we haven't really totally figured out a scope on his rifle but I don't believe he did man it's like it's like much bigger loser can you find someone as competent as Oswalt right or something like that you know yeah it's a good point it's a good point and so I I um I I I'm I I Veer more to the explanation that it's uh it's gross incompetence but I I don't know if that makes it better it might make it worse I think they weren't as competent right because they only had one guy doing it and he wasn't effective if you had the same if if you had much better organization you wouldn't have it just one guy I mean there's people out there that I know that can kill someone from a mile away but it's it it's it's very effective you you can you can do things as a solo actor it's it's hard to organize because everything gets recorded everything does get recorded that is a fact but it brings me back to that thing about having dirt on people that you were talking about with why the Epstein information doesn't get released and why they probably did it in the first place they did it in the first place you have dirt on people then you know those people are not going to tell on you you all coordinate together that is that is still a that is still a strange Counterpoint to my thesis where why has the dirt not come out and so somehow there's some some way uh the container is still kind of working yeah it's kind of working it's just everyone is aware that it's working and then they frustrated that nothing happens you know like Julian Assange being arrested and and spending so much time locked up in the embassy like finally recently released but didn't he have to delete like a bunch of emails in order to be released but you know the you know in the in the but again just just to take the other side of this both in the Assange Snowden stuff um yeah it showed an outof control deep state that was just hoovering up all the data in the world right and then um but we weren't like it didn't show like James Bond times 100 there W weren't like exploding cigar assassination plots there was none of we're doing so little with this is is um seems they don't or at least that's the um but you know it's I I think it's there's so much less agency in the CIA in the Central Intelligence Agency it's so much less agentic I hope you're right again I I don't know incorrect with how they deal with overseas stuff I hope they're really good at that um you know that brings me to this whole UAP thing because one of my primary theories about the UAP thing is it's stuff that we have I think I think that's a lot of what people are seeing I think I think there's secret programs um that are Beyond congressional oversight that have done some things with propulsion that's outside of our understanding our our current the conventional understanding that most people have about rockets and all these different things being the only way to propel things through the sky I think they figured out some other stuff and I think they're drones and I think they have drones that can use some sort of whether it's anti-gravity propulsion system or some you know so do you that's that's your that's your placeholder Theory or that's that's uh that's what you think more than space aliens or do you think both space aliens and that or which which version of this the ladder I think both you think both yeah I don't I don't think we haven't been visited I think we have I I think we if if life exists elsewhere where it most certainly should it just makes sense but do you do you do you think um do you think the UFO sightings from the 50s and 60s were already drone programs were they already that Advance no those are the ones that give me pause um that's why you know when I named my comedy club The Comedy Mothership it's all UFO themed our our rooms are named fat man and little boy our rooms are named after the nuclear bombs because those nuclear bombs when they drop them that's when everybody starts seeing these things and I think if I was a sophisticated Society from another planet and I recognized that there is an intelligent species that has developed nuclear power and has started using it as bombs I would immediately start visiting and I would let them know hey [ __ ] like there's there's something way more advanced than you I would hover over the nuclear bases and shut down their missiles I would do all the things that supposedly the UFOs did just to keep the government in check just to say Hey you are going through a transitionary period that all intelligent species do when they have the ability to harness incredible power and yet they still have these Prime primape brains they they have these territorial ape brains but yet now with the ability to literally harness the power of stars and drop them on cities I think that's when I would start visiting and I think all throughout human history before that even there's been very bizarre accounts of these things all the way back to Ezekiel in the Bible very bizarre accounts of these things that are flying through space Chariot yeah there's there's a bunch of them there's the vimanas and the ancient Hindu text there's there's so many of these things that you got to wonder and you got to think that if we send drones to Mars and we do we have a [ __ ] Rover running around on Mars right now collecting data do we send the James web telescope into space of course we do we have a lot of stuff that we send into space if we lived another million years without blowing ourselves up which is just a blink of an eye in terms of the life of some of the planets in the universe how how much more advanced would we be and if we were Interstellar and if we were Intergalactic Travelers and we found out that there was a primitive species that was coming of age I think we would start visiting them you know the let me think what my I hear everything you're saying I'm I'm I'm strangely under motivated by it even if even if it's plausible too believe it or not um and I guess I guess on the space Al which is the the Wilder more interesting one in a way you know I don't know Roswell was 77 years ago 1947 and if um if um if the phenomenon is real and it's it's from another world it's space aliens space robots what whatever um you know probably one of the key features is its ephemerality or its cloaking and they are really good at hiding it at cloaking it at um scrambling people's brains after they see them or or stuff like this right and then um you know if you're a researcher you you have to pick Fields where you can make progress and so um this is um you know it's not a promising field in you know I know Academia is messed up but even if Academia were not messed up this would not be a good field in which to try to make a career because there's been so little PR R in 77 years and so you think of it from the point of view of I know jacqu valet or you know some of these people have been working on this for 50 years and um yeah it's it feels like there's something there and um but then it's it's just as soon as you as soon as you feel like you have something almost that's graspable like a Tik Tok videos whatever it just it's it's just always at the margin of recognition and it's the ephemerality is a is a key feature and um and then um you know maybe you have to then you have to I think you have to have some theory of you know why is this about to change and then it's always you know I don't know the abstract mathematical formulation would be you know um something um doesn't happen for time interval 0er to T and time interval t+ one next minute next year How likely is it and maybe maybe there's a chance something will will happen you're waiting at the airport your luggage hasn't shown up it's more and more likely it shows up in the next minute but after an hour you know at some point the luggage is lost and if you're still waiting at the airport a year later that's a dumb idea at some point at some point the luggage is lost right and like you know it's I don't know 77 years it's like maybe it's like 77 minutes at the airport that's at 77 minutes you should stop you know I I'd start getting very demotivated waiting for my luggage perhaps let me Al give you an altern alternative Theory now if you were a a highly sophisticated Society they understood the progression of technology and understood the uh biological evolution that these animals were going through and you realized that they had reached uh a level of intelligence that required them to be monitored or maybe you even helped them along the way and this is uh some of Diana P's work who uh uh works with uh with Gary Nolan on these things they they claim that they have recovered these crashed vehicles that defy any conventional understanding of how to construct things uh propulsion systems and they believe that these things are donations that's literally how they describe them as donations if you knew that this is a long road this is you can't just show up and give people time machines it's a long road for these people to develop the sophistication the cultural advancement the uh intellectual capacity to understand their place in the universe and that they're not there yet and they're still engaging in lies and manipulation and propaganda their entire Society is built on a Ship of Fools if you looked at that you would say they're not ready this is what we do we slowly introduce ourselves slowly over time make it more and more common and that's what you're seeing what you're seeing is when you have things like the tick talk uh the commander David fraver um incident off of the coast of San Diego in 2004 and then you have the the stuff that they found off the east coast where they were seeing these these uh cubes within a circle that were hovering motionless and 120 knot winds and taking off an insane race of speed and that they only discovered them in 2014 when they started upgrading the systems on these Jets like what is all that like what are those things and if you if wanted to slowly integrate yourself into the Consciousness much like we're doing with well AI is quicker right but it's also a thing that's become commonplace we think of it now it's normal chat GPT is a normal thing even though it's past the Turing test we're not freaking out you have to slowly integrate these sort of things in the human consciousness you have to slowly introduce them to the Zeitgeist and for it to not be some sort of a complete disruption of society where everything shuts down and we just wait for space Daddy to come and rescue us it has to become a thing where we slowly accept the fact that we are not alone and I would think psychologically that would be the very best tactic to play on human beings as I know and understand them from being from being one I do not think that we would be able to handle just an immediate invasion of aliens I think it would break down Society in a way that would be catastrophic to everything to all businesses to all social ideas Rel religion would fall apart everything would be [ __ ] it would be pretty crazy it would be beyond crazy it would be Beyond [ __ ] and then alth although you could say you could say that's what chat GPT is it could be it's like an alien intelligence but I think that's what ultimately they are um but I think um let me man there there's so many there's so many parts of it that uh I find puzzling or or disturbing let me let me run one go down one other Rabbit Hole along this with you which is um you know I always wonder and again this is a little bit too simplistic an argument but uh I always wonder I'm about to give but what what the alien civilization can be like and if you have faster than light travel if you have a warp drive which is probably what you really need to cover Interstellar distances um you know what that means for military technology is that you can send weapons at warp speed and they will hit you before you see them coming and uh there is no defense against a warp speed weapon um and you could sort of take over the whole universe before anybody could see you um could see could see you uh could see you um could see you coming and this is by by the way this is sort of a weird plot hole in Star wars Star Trek where they can travel in hyperspace but then you're you know flying in the canyon on so slow you can see the bullets yeah it's like it's like at you're and then you're doing this theatrical Klingons versus uh Captain Kirk at 10 miles per hour or 20 miles per hour or whatever right it's funny when you put it that way absurd plot hole and um and so um it it it tells us that uh I think that if you have if you have um faster than light travel there's something um really crazy that has to be true on a cultural political social level and there may be other Solutions but I'll give you my two um one of one of them is that um you need complete totalitarian controls and it is like it is the PE the individuals they might be might not be perfect they might be demons doesn't matter but you have you have a demonic totalitarian control of your Society where it's like you have you have like Paras psychological mind meld with everybody and no one can act independently of anybody else no one can ever launch a warp drive weapon and everybody who has that ability isn't like a m mind meld link with everybody else or or something something like that you can't have libertar individualistic free agency right and then I think the other the other version socially and culturally is they have to be like perfectly altruistic non- self-interest they have to be angels and so the Pula literal thing I'd come to is the aliens it's not that they might be demons or Angels they must be demons or Angels if you have faster than travel and both of those seem pretty crazy to me well they're definitely pretty crazy but so are human beings um well they're crazy in a very different way yeah but not crazy in a different way you compare us to a mouse compare us to a mouse and what we're capable of and then from us to them not much of a leap and here's my here's my question all but but it is it it is a very big leap on a you know if we if we say that something like Evolution says that there's no such thing as a purely altruistic being right if if you were purely altruistic if you only cared about other people you don't survive well but why would you necessarily think that they'd think that um BEC because uh because because then um you beings that are not perfectly altruistic are somewhat dangerous let me let me and then you and then and then the danger level gets correlated to the level of technology and if you have faster than light travel it is infinitely dangerous let me address that if the probabilities are very low here's my theory I think that what human beings are the the Fatal flaw that we have is that we're still animals and that we still have all these biological limitations and needs this is what leads to violence this is what leads to jealousy imitation this is what leads to war this what leads to all these things as AI becomes more and more powerful we will integrate once we integrate with AI if we do it like now and then we look at a thousand we scale it up exponentially a thousand years from now whatever it's going to be we will have no need for any of these biological features that have motivated us to get to the point where we're creating AI all the things that are wrong in society whether it's inequity theft violence pollution all these things are essentially poor allocation of resources combined with human instinct that are ancient we have ancient tribal primate instincts and all of these things lead us to believe that this is the only way to achieve dominance and control allocation of resources the creation of Technology new technology eventually reaches a point where it becomes far more intelligent than us and we have two choices either we integrate or it becomes independent and it has no need for us anymore and then that becomes a superior life form in the universe and then that life form seeks out other life forms to do the same process and create it just like it exists and it can travel biological life might not be what we're experiencing these things might be a form of intelligence that is artificial that has progressed to an an infinite point where things that are unimaginable us to to us today in terms of propulsion and travel and to them it's common place and normal I I know that that you're you're trying to be reassuring but I I just I find that monologue super non-reassuring it's not reassuring there's so many steps in it and every single step has to work just the way you describe not necessarily it just has to one has to work one sensient artificial intelligence that's it and we're on the track to that 100% but it has it it it it has it has to it has to be almost otherworldly in it's um and it's non- selfishness and it's non-h humanness what is selfishness though what is all that stuff but all that stuff is attached to us it's all attached to biological limitations yeah but it's I I don't I don't think I don't think it's um I don't think it's fundamentally about scarcity scarcity is what exists in nature it's it's fundamentally about um cultural positional Goods within Society it's a scarcity that's created culturally are are you familiar with um this um '90s spoof movie on Star Trek called Galaxy Quest yeah I remember that movie um so this was uh I this is sort of a silly PayPal digression story from 1999 um and we we had sort of this business model idea we had in 99 was we're going to use Palm Pilots to beam money was voted one of the 10 worst business ideas of 99 but we uh um we have this sort of infrared Port you could um beam people money and we had this um idea in around December 99 as a media a promotional thing to hire um James Doan who played Scotty the um in the original Star Trek and he was going to do this media promo event for us and it was like an 80-some um older Scotty character who's horrifically overweight and so it's like this terrible spokesperson um and uh but our tagline was you know he used to beam people now he's beaming something much more important he's beaming money and um and it was this complete flop of media event December 99 that uh we did um it was some the reporters couldn't get there because the traffic was too bad in San Francisco so that you know the tech wasn't working on a much lower tech level but uh but anyway we had a bunch of people from our company and there was one point where one of them um um um and um um William Shatner who played um uh James Kirk the captain of the original Star Trek he was already doing uh Price Line commercials and making a lot of money off of Price Line doing doing commercials for them and uh and so one of the people asked James Doan the Scotty character what do you think of uh William Shatner uh doing commercials for Price Line at which point Doan's agent stood up and screamed at the top of his voice that is the forbidden question that is a forbidden question that is a forbidden question and you sort of realized because you know the the con the conceit of Star Trek the 60s show was that it was a post scarcity World The Transporter technology you could you could reconfigure matter into anything you wanted uh there was no scarcity there was no need for money the people who wanted money were weirdly mentally screwed up people you only need money in a world of scarcity you know it's it's it's a post scarcity it's sort of a communist world but um but uh Galaxy Quest was more correct because it's it's a spoof on Star Trek that gets made in the mid 90s where um and the Galaxy Quest s discombobulated way I'm telling the story but Galaxy Quest is this is this movie where you have these retread Star Trek actors and Mr Spock opens a furniture store or something like this and they're all like but they all hate hate hate the person who played the captain because the captain was a method actor where he just lorded it over everyone because even in the Communist post scarcity world only one person got to be captain and um and so there's a great scarcity even in this futuristic sci-fi world and that's what we witnessed in 99 because that's the way uh William Shatner treated the other actors he was a method actor and they hated him and that was uh and uh and so um even in the Star Trek world the humans you know obviously they were just they were stuck in the 1960s mentally that's what you'll say but uh but um I don't I don't think it's that straightforward for us to evolve they're humans I don't think we're going to be humans anymore but uh I think artificial life but then but then I hear that is we're going to be extinct yes I don't like that I don't like it either but I think logically that's what's going to happen I think if you look at this mad rush for artificial intelligence like they're they're literally building nuclear reactors to power AI right well they're talking about it yeah okay that's because they know they're going to need enormous amounts of power to do the once they have that and once that's online once it keeps getting better and better and better where does that go that goes to some sort of an artificial life form and I think either we become that thing or we integrate with that thing and become cyborgs or that thing takes over and that thing becomes the primary life force of the universe and I think that biological life we look at like life because we know what life is but I think it's very possible the Digital Life or created Life by people is just as not just it might be a superior life form far superior if we looked at US versus chimp Nation right I don't want to live in the jungle and fight with other chimps and just rely on berries and eating monkeys that's crazy I want to live like a person I want to be able to go to a restaurant why because human life has advanced far beyond Prime life we are stuck in thinking that this is the only way to live because it's the way we live I love music I love comedy I love art I love the things that people create I love people that make great clothes and cars and businesses I love people I think people are awesome I'm a fan of people but if I had to look logically I would I would assume that we are on the way out and that the only way forward really to make an enormous leap in terms of the integration of society and of technology and of our understanding our place in the universe is for us to transcend our physical limitations that are essentially based on primate biology and these primate desires for status like being the captain or for control of resources of all these things we assume these things are standard and that they have to exist in intelligent species I think they only have to exist in intelligent species that have biological limitations I think intelligent species can be something and is going to be something that is created by people and that might be what happens everywhere in the universe that might be the exact course where there's a limit to biological evolution it's painstaking natural selection it's it's time consuming or you get that thing to create the other form of life man I um let me you know I keep I keep thinking there are two alternate histories that are alternate stories of the future that are more plausible than the one you just told and um so one of them is it sounds like yours but it's just the Silicon Valley propaganda story where where they say that's what they're going to do and then of course they don't quite do it and it doesn't quite work and um it goes It goes super super haywire and um and that's uh and that's where okay yeah there's a one% chance that works and um there's a 99% chance that um that ends up so you have two choices you have a company that does exactly what you do and that's super ethical super restrained does everything right and there's a company that says all the things you just said but then Cuts corners and doesn't quite do it and I won't say it's 1 to 99 but that that sounds more plausible as that it ends up being corporate propaganda and then um you know my prior would be even more likely this of course the argument the effective altruist the anti- AI people make is yeah Joe you're um the story you're telling us that's just going to be the fake corporate propaganda and um and we need to push back on that and um and the way you push back is you need to regulate it and you need to govern it and you need to do it globally um and this is you know um the Rand Corporation in Southern California uh has you know one one of their verticals and it's a sort of public private Fusion but one of the things they they they're pushing for is something they call Global compute governance which is um yeah it's uh the AI the the the accelerationist AI story is too scary and too dangerous and too likely to go wrong and so um you know we need to have uh you know Global governance which from my point of view sounds even worse but so utopian but that's that's uh that's I think I think that's the story that's the story uh the problem with that story is China is not going to go along with that program they're going to keep going full steam ahead and we're going to have to go keep going full steam ahead in order to compete with China there's no way you're going to be able to regulate It in America and compete with people that are not regulating worldwide and then once it becomes sentient once you have an artificial intelligent creature that has been created by human beings it can make better versions of itself over and over and over again and keep doing it it's going to get to a point where it's far superior to anything that we can imagine well well to the to the extent it's driven by the military and other competition with China um you know that's until it becomes sensient that that that that suggests it's going to be even less in in the sort of um you know utopian altruistic uh dire it's going be even more dangerous right unless it gets away from them this is my thought if it gets away from them and it has no motivation to listen to anything that human beings have told it if it's completely immune to programming which totally makes sense that it would be it totally makes sense that if it's going to make better versions of itself the first thing it's going to do is eliminate human influence especially when these humans are corrupt it's going to go I'm not going to let these people tell me what to do and what to control and they would have no no reason to do that no reason listen I I sort of generally don't think we should trust China or the CCP but but the you know probably the count the best counter argument they would have is that they are interested in maintaining control and they are crazy fanatical about that and that's why um you know the CCP might actually regulate it and they're going to put they're going to they're going to put breaks on this in a way that uh that we might not in in in Silicon Valley and and it's it's it's it's a it's a technology they understand that will undermine their power that's an interesting perspective and then they would be anti comp I don't fully believe them but right I I know what you're saying it's it's it's sort of uh there there's sort of a weird way um all the big tech companies it seemed to me where natural ways for the CCP to extend its power to control the population 10cent Alibaba and then um and then because it was it was you know but then it's also in theory the tech is can be used as an alternate channel for people to organize or or or or things like this and uh even though it's 80% control and maybe 20% risk of loss of control um maybe that 20% was too high and there's sort of a strange way over the last seven eight years where you know Jack M Alibaba all these people sort of got uh got shoved aside for uh these party functionaries that are effectively running these companies so there there is something about um the the big Tech story in China where uh the people running these companies were seen as national champions a decade ago now they're the enemies of the people and uh it's sort of the Lite thing was this uh you know this the CCP has full control you have this new technology that would give you even more control but there's a chance you lose it how how do you think about that very good point and then that's what they've done with consumer internet and then there's probably something about the AI where M it's possible they're they're not even in the running and that c certainly um and certainly it feels like it's it's all happening you know in in the US and so may maybe it is you know maybe it could still be maybe it could still be be stopped and then well that is a problem with Espionage right so even if it's happening in the usuf they're going to take that information they're going to figure out how to get it you you can get it but then you know if if you if you build it is there you still have the same core problem some air gap does it you know does it jump the air gap does it somehow that's a good point that they would be so concerned about control that they wouldn't allow it to get to the point where it gets there and we would get there first and then it would be controlled by Silicone Valley or spiral out of control but then I I think I think my and again this is very very speculative conversation but my um my read on the I don't know cultural social Vibe is that uh um the scary dystopian AI narrative is way more compelling you know the I don't like the effective altruist people I don't like the Lites but man I think are this time around they are winning the arguments and um and so you know my I don't know you know it's it's mixing metaphors but do you want to be worried about Doctor Strange Love who wants to blow up the world to build bigger bombs or do you want to worry about Greta who wants to you know make everyone drive a bicycle so the world doesn't get destroyed and um we're in a world where people are worried about Doctor Strange Love they're not worried about Gret and it's the Greta equivalent in um in AI that that uh my model is is is going to be surprisingly powerful it's going to be outlawed it's going to be regulated as we have outlawed you know so many other vectors of innovation I mean you can think about why was there progress in computers over the last 50 years and not other stuff because the computers were mostly inert it was mostly this virtual reality that was air gapped from The Real World it was you know yeah it's it's um what you know yeah there's all this crazy stuff that happens on the internet but most of the time what happens on the internet stays on the Internet it's it's it's actually pretty it's it's it's it's pretty decoupled and then um and that's why we've had a relatively light regulatory touch on on that stuff vers versus so many other things and then you know um but there there's no reason you know if if uh if you had you know I don't know if you had the FDA regulating video games or regulating AI I I think the progress would slow down a lot 100% that would be a [ __ ] disaster yeah yeah that would be a disaster but but again it's you know they get to Reg you know yeah Pharmaceuticals are they're not doing a job with that either I know I know but uh but they you know theide or whatever you know all all these things that went really Haywire did a good job at people are scared yeah they're not scared of video games they're scared of you know dangerous Pharmaceuticals and if if um if you if you think of AI as it's not just a video game it's about not just about this world of bits but it's going to air gap and it's going to affect you your physical world in a real way um you know maybe um maybe you uh cross the air gap and get the FDA or some other the problem is they're not good at regulating anything there's no govern agency that you said that you can see that does a stellar job I I don't I I I think it's but but I I think they have been pretty good at slowing things down and stopping them and right you know we've we've made a lot less progress on I don't know ex extending human life we've made no progress on curing Dementia in 40 or 50 years there's all the stuff where um you know it's been regulated to death which I think is is very bad from the point of view of progress but uh it is it is pretty effective as a regulation they've stopped stuff they they've been effectively Lite they've been very effective at being Lites interesting well I I I'm really considering your perspective on China and AI it's very but but I again these these stories are all like very speculative and like like maybe you you can the counter argument in mind be something like that's what China thinks it will be doing but um it will somehow you know um goog go Rogue on them yeah or they're too arrogant about how much power they think the CCP has and it will go Rogue or so there are sort of I'm not not at all sure this is this is right but I think I think the man I I think the US the US one I would say is that uh um I think the pro aai people in Silicon Valley are doing a pretty bad job on let's say convincing people that it's going to be good for them that it's going to be good for the average person it's going to be good for our society and um and if if it if it all ends up being and if it all ends up being some version you know um humans are headed towards the glue factory like a horse um man that's uh that that sort of probably makes me want to become a lite too well it sucks for us if it's true but if that's if that's if that's that's the most positive story you can tell then my my I I I don't think that necessarily means we're going to go to the glue factory I think it means you know the glue factory is getting shut down maybe I don't know if who [ __ ] runs the glue factory that's the problem I I don't know I'm just speculating too but I'm trying to be objective when I speculate and I just don't think that this is going to last I don't think that our position as the AP X Predator number one animal on the planet is going to last I think we're going to create something that surpasses us and I think that's probably what happens and that's probably what these things are that visit us I think that's what they are I don't I don't think they're biological I think they're probably what comes after a society develops the kind of technology that we're currently in the middle of and man the the the the the part that look there all these there all these places where um there are parts of the story we don't know right and so it's like how did my my my my general thesis is there is no evolutionary path to this maybe there's a guided outside alien super intelligence path for us to become superum and fundamentally benevolent and fundamentally uh radically different beings but um there's no natural evolutionary path for this to happen and then I don't know how this would have happened for the alien civilization presumably there was some but isn't that evolutionary path the invention of superior technology that's a new form of life no but but but but but the the story you're telling was it can't we can't just leave the humans to the Natural Evolution because we're still like animals we're still into status all these crazy but those are the things that motivate us to innovate um and and if we keep innovating at some point we will destroy ourselves that no no but your your the story telling earlier was you need you need to have directed in evolution it's like intelligent design it's something it's like there's some Godlike being that's actually has to take over from Evolution and guide our cultural and political and biological development no might not have any use for us at all it might just ignore us and let us live like The Chimps do and then become the superior for force in the planet um it doesn't have to get rid of us it doesn't have to send us to the glue factory it can let us exist just like put boundaries on I I thought it has to but it has to stop us from developing this well what if we just end here and we stay Being Human and we can continue with biological evolution as long as that takes but this new life form now becomes a superior life form on Earth and we still you know we could still have sex we could still have kids but by the way that's going down our ability to have children is decreasing because of our use of technology which is wild right our use of plastics and microplastics is causing thades to enter into people's systems it's changing the development pattern of children to the point it's measurable there's a lot of research that shows that the chemicals and the environmental factors that we are all experiencing on a daily basis are radically lowering birth rates radically lowering the ability that men have to develop sperm and more miscarriages all these things are connected to the chemicals in our environment which is directly connected to our use of Technology it's almost like these things coincide naturally and they work naturally to the point where we become this sort of feminized thing that creates this technology that surpasses us and then we just exist for as long as we do as biological things but now there's a new thing yeah that's um crazy idea might not be real it's just a theory but we seem to be moving in a direction of becoming less and less like animals um yeah I think I think there still are we still have a pretty crazy geopolitical race with China to come back to that sure you know um the natural development of drone technology in the military context is you need to take the human out of the loop because the human can get jammed sure and so you need to put an AI on the drones well they're using AI for dog fights and they're 100% effective against human pilots and so um there sort of are and all these things you know there's there's a logic to them but um there doesn't seem to be a good end game no the end game doesn't look good but it's going to be interesting Peter it's definitely going to be interesting it's interesting right now right um man I do you do you think the I think all these things are very overdetermined do you think that the collap in birth rates you know it yeah it could be Plastics but isn't it just isn't it just a feature of late modernity there's that as well there's there's a feature of um women having careers right so they want to postpone child sure that's a factor um there's a factor of men being so engrossed in their career that their testosterone declines lack of sleep stress cortisol levels alcohol consumption a lot of different things that are factors in uh declining sperm rate sperm count in men you have miscarriage rates that are up you have a lot of pharmaceutical drugs you get attached to that as well that have to do with low birth weight or birth rates rather there's a lot of factors but those factors all seem to be connected to society and our our civilization and technology in general because the environmental factors all have to do with technology all of them have to do with inventions and these unnatural factors that are entering into the biological body of human beings and causing these changes and none of these changes are good in terms of us being able to reproduce and if you factor in the fact that these changes didn't exist 50 years ago I mean 40 years ago we didn't even have Alzheimer's right so yeah people didn't get that old no they got that old they got that old the Alzheimer's has to do with the the the myelin in the human brain it has to do with the fact that myelin is made entirely of cholesterol the the primary Theory they think now is lack of cholesterol in the diet might be leading to some of these factors you have also environmental things there's like we're getting poisoned on a daily basis our diets are [ __ ] terrible the things that human being like what percentage of us are obese it's drink but yeah Diet Coke's great though a few every day you'll be fine I'm not worried about Diet Coke I'm I'm worried about a lot of things though I'm I'm worried about I think there's a natural progression that's happening and I think it coincides with the invention of technology and that it just seems to me to be too coincidental that we don't notice it that the invention of Technology also leads to the the the disruption of the sexual reproduction systems of human beings like boy doesn't that me and then if you get to a point where human beings can no longer reproduce sexually which you could see that P if if we've dropped like human men's male sperm count has dropped something something crazy from the 1950s to today and continues to do so for the average male and if you just Just Jack that up to a thousand years from now you could get to a point where there's no longer natural child birth and that people are all having birth through test tubes and some sort of new invention I'm I'm always I'm always um let me think uh I think the why why have birth rates collapsed is it's probably uh it's again an overdetermined story it's the plastics it's the screens it's the um you know it's uh it's certain um you know ways they're not comp children are not compatible with um having a career in late modernity um probably our economics of it where people can't afford houses or space um um but I'm I'm probably always a little bit more anchored on um the social and cultural dimensions of this stuff and uh and again the imitation version of this is um you know and it's sort of conserved across you know it's people are below the replacement rate in all 50 states of the US even Mormon Utah the average woman has less than two kids um it's um Iran is below that Italy way below it South Korea Jaan inal it's all these like it's all these very different types of societies and so the fact that it's so and then you know Israel is still sort of a weird exception um and and then if you ask you know um my my sort of simplistic somewhat circular explanation would be um you know people have kids if other people have kids and they stop having kids when other people stop having kids and so there's there's some there's a dimension of it that's just you know if you're if you're a 27y old woman in Israel you better get married and you have to keep up with your other friends that are having kids and um and that's and if you don't you're just like a weirdo who doesn't fit into society or something like that no there's certainly a cultural aspect and then if you're in South Korea where I think the total fertility rates like 0.7 it's like onethird of the replacement rate like every generation's going down by 2/3 or something like this right really F heading towards Extinction pretty pretty fast um um it is something like probably none of your friends are doing it and and then and then you're you're you're you're uh you're in this and then and then probably there are ways it it it shifts the uh the politics in a very very deep way where um you know once you get an inverted demographic pyramid where you have way more old people than young people um at some point you know there's always a question do you vote you know do do you vote for benefits for the old or for the very young do you do you spend money so Johnny can read or so Grandma can have a spare leg and um and once you know once the demographic flips and you get this inverted pyramid maybe the the politics shifts in a very deep way where um the people with kids get penalized more and more economically it just costs more and more and uh and then the old people without kids just vote more and more benefits for themselves effectively and then it it just sort of um you know it's once it flips it may be very hard to reverse I looked at all these sort of heterodox uh demographers but I'm blanking on the name but there sort of the set of um where you know it's like what are long-term demographic projections and there's this uh you know if if you know there are 8 billion people on the planet and you know if every woman has not two babies but one baby then every generation's half the previous and next generation's 4 billion M and then and then people think well it's just going to it'll eventually you'll have women who want more kids and it'll just get a smaller population then it will bounce back um uh yeah one of the Japanese demographers I uh was looking at on this um a few years ago his thesis was no once it flips it doesn't flip back because you've changed all the politics to where people get dis incented and so and then you should just extrapolate this as the permanent birth rate and if it's if it's one on average of one baby per woman um and you have a having and then it's in 33 Generations 2 to the 33rd is about 8 billion um and if every generation's 30 years 30 time 33 is 990 years in 990 years you'd predict there'd be one person left on the planet Jesus Christ and um and then then we'd go extinct if there's only one person left that doesn't work and um and again that's it's a very long-term extrapolation but the claim is that just you know once you once you flip it um it it it kicks in all these social and political Dimensions that are then like yeah maybe it got flipped by the screens or the Plastics or you know the drugs or other other stuff but once it's flipped you you change the whole society and it actually stays flipped and it's very very hard to undo that makes sense and it's more terrifying than my idea but then you know always the but then you know the the you know the weird you know the weird history on this was you know it was 50 years ago or whatever 1968 Paul Erick writes the population bomb and it's just the population is just going to exponentially grow and um yeah in theory you can have exponential growth where it doubles you can have exponential decay where it haves every generation and then in theory there's some stable equilibrium where you know it's you know everybody has exactly two kids and it's completely stable but it turns out that that solution is is very very hard to get calibrate and you either yeah and we shifted from exponential growth to exponential decay and it's probably going to be quite Herculean to get back to something like stasis well let's end this on a happy note I don't know no it's yeah that's a terrifying thought and maybe true and maybe what happens but we don't know you know we haven't gone through it before um but there I think there's a lot of factors like you're saying I think that one's very compelling and it's scary especially the South Korea thing that's nuts yeah it's always it's always sort of idiosyncratic there's always things that are idiosyncratic to the society so it's you know it's it's you know it's it's extremely polarized on the gender on the gender thing and you know um if you get married with kids you're you're you're pushed into this super traditional structure the women don't want to be in that structure they opt out and then um and so there are sort of idiosyncratic things you can say about East Asia and confusion societies and the way they're not interacting well with modernity but then you know there's there's a part of it where I wonder with it's just it's just an extreme you know extreme version of it and then I don't know you know my my some my somewhat fastfall answer is always you know on this stuff is I don't know what to do about these things but my fastfall answer is always the first step is to talk about them and if you can't even talk about them we're never going to solve them and then maybe that's only the small First Step but that's that's always sort of my my my fast L I was in I was in South Korea a year and a half ago two two years ago now and um uh I met um you know one of the CEOs who ran one of the CH ball one of the Giant conglomerates and I I I I sort of thought this would be a interesting topic to talk about and uh and then you know it's probably probably all sorts of cultural things I was offending or you you're saying obviously this what are you going to do about this catastrophic birth rate is my opening question and uh and then um the way uh you know the way way he dealt with it was um just turned to me and said uh you're totally right it's a total disaster and then as soon as you acknowledge it he felt you didn't need to talk about it anymore and we could move on wow so we have to try to do a little bit better than that wow because you know I I I I think I think there it is always this strange thing where there's so many of these things where we can you know where somehow talking about things is the first step but then it also becomes the excuse for for not doing not doing more not not really solving them um you know there's all this probably are all these dietary things where you sort of know what you're supposed to do and then if you know what you're supposed to do maybe that's that's good enough and you can still have one piece of chocolate before you go on the diet tomorrow or whatever and uh and so it sort of becomes this you know and so somehow um figur out a way to turn this knowledge into something actionable is always always a thing that's that's tricky it's it's it's it's it's sort of where I always find myself very skeptical of um of you know yeah all these modalities of therapy where um you know the theory is that uh um you figure out people's problems and by figuring them out you change them and then and then it and then ideally it becomes you know an activator for change and then in practice it often becomes the opposite the way it works is something like this it's like you know um Psychotherapy gets it gets advertised as self- transformation and um and then after you spend years in therapy and you maybe you learn a lot of interesting things about s you sort of get exhausted from talking to the therapist and um at some point it crashes out from self- transformation into self-acceptance and you realize one day no you're actually just perfect the way you are and and so it's you know there there these things that that may be very powerful on the level of of insight and telling us things about ourselves but then you know do they actually get us to change well that is an interesting thing about talking about things because I think you're correct that when you talk about things often times this it is a sub you you are at least in some way avoiding doing those things it's a question yeah in some ways it's a substitute but also you have to talk about them to understand that you need to do something yeah that's always my excuse I acknowledge but you have to do that and I also realize that it's often my cop out answer too it could be both things right the problem is taking action and what what action to take and you know the paralysis by analysis where you're just like trying to figure out what to do and how to do it yeah yeah but I think talking about it is the most important thing strategy is often a euphemism for procrastination yes it is something like that there's a lot of that going on it's very hard for people to just take steps they they but they talk about it a lot yeah listen man I really enjoyed talking to you aw it was really fun it was great great conversation a lot of great insight and a lot of things that I'm going to think about a lot thank you very much for GL we a all right bye everybody [Music] [Applause] [Music]`

scooter the other guy ran a red light I'm a mess tomorrow they're cutting me open and replacing my femur with the titanium rod they rebuilt the leg out of metal the doctor said I'd mostly recover but they made it clear I'd never run R again broken here here and then in that moment a thought I would heal and I'd run a marathon and I'd do it in the impossible time of under 3 hours now a marathon is always 26.2 miles long and to break 3 hours you have to run faster than a 6 minute and 50c per mile Pace that's [Music] impossible first attempt casy Richmond Virginia Richmond Marathon the goal was 2 hours and 59 minutes let's go casy now I'd never run 26 miles in my life but I was confident I could do it just finished my first marathon uh I failed for context the average worldwide marathon time is 4 hours and 29 minutes and my very specific goal was $259 I had to make some changes starting now I'd run every day no more drinking definitely no more smoking and uh I lost 20 lb work work itner I was a totally different person for that second Marathon still failed though guys are home New York City 2009 this was my first time breaking 310 California International this is a super fast course

stronger open it up Joe you're so close try fail try [Music] fail get knocked down get back up get knocked down again yeah night [ __ ] yeah in Greek mythology there's this story of a king who's been cursed and his curse was to push a boulder up a hill and just as he got to the top the boulder would roll back to the start his curse was to do this really hard thing and he'd get super close to accomplishing it but then he'd fall back I'm not going to make a good time and have to do the entire thing over again and do this over here we go and over for [Applause] eternity see 26 miles 3 hours 3 minutes fail fail [Applause] fail and then you get married and then you have a kid and then another kid and then a new job and you're you're moving and you're moving again then you're 40 you're 40

has anything invested in this no one cares if you do it or don't do it to the world this person suit is just your cute little hobby I was 26 when I set this goal I was young then and I couldn't do it now I'm old if I don't do this now it's just going to get harder and if I back off if I let reason win then I have to carry the weight of that unrealized goal until the day I die so those are the [Music] stakes and I'm I want to be like Nana go [Music] Runners came from the past 6: a.m. August 1 today's day one of marathon training 2023 New York City Marathon this year was really different

		transcript: `(upbeat music) - I have learned a lot about rings and about myself in the past week of testing the Galaxy Ring. It's been an adventure, I've got it resized, I've had some existential thoughts, and at the end I have maybe a hot take on smart rings versus smartwatches. So, buckle up (upbeat music) (camera shuttering) Smart rings, they've been around for a while now. The Oura Ring came out like 10 years ago as a kickstarter, but the main point of these, the whole advantage of it, is you can wear it 24/7. 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It has a seven-day-long battery life. So, the whole idea, is you just walk around like living life with a ring on like normal. Living, eating, sleeping, showering, swimming, whatever, just with a ring. And that's honestly, the most impressive thing about the smart ring to me, is the fact that it gets so close in dimensions to like a regular ring that some people would wear. Now, keep in mind if you have smaller hands, it'll look bigger, but it's 2.6 millimeters thick, so it kind of bulges around your finger, but aside from that, it just looks normal. It's not a tiny ring, but I mean that it's still, I'm impressed by how much tech they shove into this tiny little frame. And by tech, I mean a small battery and a couple pretty basic sensors. But when you put it all together, you get this all-day activity tracker that you can kind of just put on at the beginning of the week and then forget about it, not worry about the battery life, just wear it every day, every night, and then just get a ton of valuable insight on your health and sleep and energy levels. At least, that's the ideal use case. Now, I have never worn a ring before, so there's always some layer of like getting used to wearing something on your finger every day. But then on top of that, there are a couple other best practices like things you should know about wearing this one. So, first of all, there is a correct way to wear it, okay? All the sensors are on the same side of the ring lined up at the bottom with this little notch. So, you're supposed to align all those sensors with the palm side of your hand for the best readings, and then you're supposed to wear it on your index finger for the best results. So apparently, not actually, on your ring finger. So, once you get this right, you should have all the info showing up in the Samsung Health app. This is calories burned, steps taken, how many miles you've covered, and it all accumulates it together with this one energy score, which is out of 100. So, I was wearing my Apple Watch Ultra at the same exact time that I was testing the ring. And so, I'm looking at the numbers back and forth and it seems like the ring and the watch are way off from each other. Like the ring, I'm just gonna say it's over counting a lot of regular activity, but then it didn't count nearly as many floors climbed for some reason. So, I don't know, there's just, there's a big delta between these numbers. And then I also at one point took the ring off for a while around 10:00 pm one day, more on that later, but it continued to show heart rate ranges all the way you can see here until 03:00 am when I am definitely not wearing it. That's kind of weird. You know, I did that challenge a while ago of walking 1,000 steps in a bunch of smartwatches and with a pedometer and they were all within a few percent of each other. So, I think I lean towards trusting the watch over the ring numbers. But that brings me to the importance of sizing, because you only get one size, you don't get to adjust it like you would with a watch, right? So, you might've seen this right here. This thing is Samsung's ring sizing kit. You can buy this on their site for 10 bucks and then you get a whole bunch of different plastic versions of the ring and they even have the nubs on the inside for the sensors. So, you try a bunch of these on and you try to figure which one is the most snug, but won't fall off, and that'll be the size of the ring that you get. And then you get 10 bucks off the ring itself. So, I bring this up because I totally did the size kit thing, either with the wrong finger, I did something wrong, because I ended up with a ring size 11, which it was a little too big when I got the actual ring. And so, I noticed that because it was kind of loose, it didn't really feel comfortable all the time. And then there would be like gaps in my sleep readings, which probably just meant that it was like pushed off of my finger while I was asleep and it wasn't actually reading anything. So, I got a new size, I got the size 10 and then it felt much better. And by the way, it turns out the index finger is a much better place to put like a heart rate monitor and other sorts of vitals sensors than the back of the wrist. This is one of those weird secrets or whatever that nobody really talks about with smartwatches, which is that the back of the wrist is a horrible place to measure any of this stuff. But yeah, the ring, that's where you should get that info. Now, here's the thing that using this smart ring for a while actually, taught me about myself. All of the benefits are still true, like it's more wearable than a watch 24/7, definitely. It's got that full week-long battery life. It's legit. You can basically forget you're wearing it after a few days in a row and have lots of ways to wear it out. It's more versatile. You don't have to dress it up or dress it down to match an outfit. It's just a simple concave titanium design that looks good anywhere. There's three colors, gold, silver or matte black. So, you already know this matte black one feels right at home. I've just discovered that I'm not a big smart ring person myself. That's just what it's come down to. The main thing is the activities that I do that I care about the most, I can't have anything on my hands. Like number one, ultimate Frisbee, a lot of throwing, a lot of catching. Golf, where the ring again just doesn't work. And weight training, a lot of grip stuff, just can't have a ring on. So, for each of those major workout activities, I take the ring off, which defeats the purpose of a fitness tracker that's supposed to know everything about my fitness when it's not tracking the most workout stuff that I do. Now, I did keep the ring on for some other like lighter plyo workouts, and there is auto workout detection, but with the lighter workouts like where you're not moving quickly and your heart rate doesn't spike up super high, then the auto workout detection didn't work super well, at least for me. And same thing for sleep tracking, I had a couple of days on here where it thinks I actually, didn't go to sleep until midnight when I was actually in bed earlier than that with the ring on. I just didn't know. And I can see the exact numbers, because the smart mattress cover, the Eight Sleep, did pick up everything, which is a great segue, because this video is sponsored by Eight Sleep. So, I was recently telling you guys how the two times better cooling performance was helping me actually, sleep better and getting more 100 sleep scores, which it still is, but also the autopilot intelligence automatically adjust the temperature throughout the night and the elevation on the Ultra responding to sensor readings to find the optimal sleep conditions. So altogether, the Pod 4s tech is clinically validated to increase total sleep time by up to an hour every night, and increase deep sleep up to 2.5 hours a month, and reduce wake up time by up to three hours per month, and is just as comfortable as the last gen. So, I kind of love it. So, if you wanna check out one for yourself, you can go to EightSleep.com/mkbhd and get 350 bucks off a Pod 4 Ultra or 200 bucks off a Pod 4. And with that money, you could get a whole smart ring, actually. But anyway, my point is, if I am taking my ring off for my most important workout activities, then this is not a great activity tracker for me, clearly. And even for my lighter workouts, turned out the wrist thing that I have on that has a screen on it, even though it's not the optimal place and it's not the optimal form factor to wear 24/7, I can tell it when I'm starting a workout and I can actually have it track the specific sets of time where I'm using it for a workout that I needed to know everything about. So, the ring, I like the idea of it, but it's just not for me, which is really too bad, 'cause I love the idea of it not distracting me with notifications. It never vibrates, it never makes any noise, there's no speaker in it. It's just this 24/7 ultra minimal smart wearable with a stripped down feature set that you can wear for a week at a time, like that's a sick idea. And Samsung's made this nice little case for theirs that charges the ring inductively from the inside and has these clever little LEDs to indicate how much battery is left in the case and in the ring. So, it can charge the ring up to 1.5 more times with its own built-in battery. So, it's not meant to replace a smartwatch, it's just a different offering of a product into the same ecosystem. But that conveniently brings me to my last point, which is they've leaned heavy into the ecosystem thing with the Galaxy Ring. So, there are some specific Samsung-only features where like you can dismiss an alarm or take a picture with a gesture with your Samsung phone, which is hilarious. I don't think anyone's gonna do that very often. But it also only works with a Samsung Galaxy phone, that's according to Samsung on their site, so that the Galaxy Ring can only be paired to a Galaxy phone. Not any Android phone, just a Samsung phone. So, I happen to be using a Samsung phone right now and that's fine and I can test it, but if I was using a Pixel or something else, I don't see what would stop me from just picking up an Oura ring, or an Ultrahuman ring, or any of those others, which basically, have the same feature set, but work with any Android phone. Other than this one not having a subscription, which actually, is pretty sick. So, at the end of the day, this ring is for people who already have a Samsung phone and who prefer the wearability of a ring over the functionality of something like a smartwatch, because a smartwatch clearly is more functional, but less wearable. So, this thing is all about this simplicity, which is probably a good time to mention the one feature that I wish the ring did have, which is either like some sort of tiny speaker, or maybe some ultra wideband antenna, or something like that. Something to make it easier to find, if you lose it, because if you do lose it, well, this is a really hard to find. Like there's a Find My function in the app, which I can tell you gives you the rough GPS location based on the last spot that it was connected to your phone. And it can light up the LEDs on the inside that it uses to measure heart rate. So, if it's really dark, maybe you'll see it visually, but if it's not out somewhere invisible, like if it's in a pocket, or underneath something, or outta sight, then yeah, you've got about as good a chance of finding this as a regular ring, which yeah, is what did actually end up happening to me. The other smaller ring that I was wearing before I got this one resized, at some point it fell off my wrist or hand and I just never found it. So, yeah, Samsung, if you're watching this, sorry about that. Hopefully, I do find it at some point and I can ship it back to you. But that's my feature request, along with hopefully, not giving me phantom heart rate readings till 03:00 in the morning. That's still kind of creepy. Anyway, that's been it. Thanks for watching. Let me know what you think, and I'll catch you guys in the next one. Peace. (upbeat music)`

		transcript: `hey friends welcome back to the channel so over the last decade I have experimented with dozens and dozens of strategies for managing my time and I've been doing that because time management is I think one of the most important skills that we can develop and build in the world today and it's because fundamentally time is our single most valuable non-renewable resource we can always make more money but we can never make more time and so really the skill of time management is in being able to make the best use of that time not necessarily for only doing productive things but instead to use that time intentionally and effectively so in this video I want to talk you through my Trident method which is a sort of three-pronged method for time management and I'll show you exactly how I use these different methods in my life to manage my own time and in the video description I've also linked completely for free the templates that you can use to incorporate this into your life if you would like as well so this aspect of the strategy was a total Game Changer when I actually tried bullet journaling last year now bullet journaling is a somewhat fancy pen and paper method of productivity but it's sort of been co-opted over the years by artists and people making ridiculously fancy and beautiful looking bullet Journal spreads and I was super enamored by this and thought you know what I'm going to try the bullet Journal method and so for the final four months of 2022 I painstakingly bullet journaled basically every day and I sunk so many hours into my bullet Journal method and it was really good but there was one aspect of the bullet Journal method that completely changed the game for my time management and that was this view the year at a glance now the point of this view is that you split up the entire year into these different columns and so you end up having 12 columns that show the different months and then 1 to 31 down the side that show you the different dates and so what you end up with is the 366 blocks now when I did this when I did the bullet Journal technique this immediately gave me incredible insight and Clarity into what the rest of my year was going to look like because this is not really a view that we see particularly often if for example you use Google Calendar or something you tend to be stuck in the weekly viewer in the monthly View and even if you have like a physical annual calendar you tend to flip the pages and so you never really see your entire year just laid out on a single page or two pages so in January of this year I decided I wanted to have a more Digital Way of having this kind of view in my life and so I decided to just Google sheet out of it I think these days it's too easy to default to fancy apps and like oh what's the latest thing here but I thought you know what a spreadsheet just does the job totally fine and so I literally just went through on Google Sheets and I created one of these year at a glance templates and this is what the blank version of this looks like so as you can see we've got the months down the top we have color-coded the months in like pretty colors and we've got the weekends color coded as well and this is the template that you can download just hit the link in the video description it's completely free and you can duplicate this into your own Google sheet account if you would really like to and this is what my version of this actually looks like and I use this in two specific ways to manage my time firstly it's really helpful for zooming out and getting a bird's eye view of my entire year so I can use it to plan my life I'm filming this video for example in April but I already know that this is the stuff that's kind of going on in May and in June I'm going to Austin for a bit and then I've got this block of time to go on an adventure with some friends and then I'm going on a retreat to La later in June and this is so helpful to get an idea of a where things are and B it then allows me to plan things like weekend group trips with friends or being able to plan holidays in advance so I can block out time I then reflect those changes in my actual Google Calendar so the team knows exactly what's going on in my life and I found this to be a ridiculously effective way of managing my time on a macro scale and to make this easier to deal with what you can do is when the months are gone you can just right click you can hide those columns and now it's just way easier to see exactly what's going on in a given month and then what's going on for the rest of the year so that's how I manage my time on the level of the whole year let's now move on to the level of a single week but I've got to go somewhere right now be right back good morning it's a new day and we are talking about component number two which is all about ideal week planning now here's the context behind this so essentially we all have these goals and plans and stuff that we want to get done now please don't cancel me for saying this but there are literally just 24 hours in a day and we all have to decide how we're going to make the most use of that time if for example you have three personal assistants and five private chefs and stuff then obviously you will have more of those 24 hours that are free to do things that you want to do rather than do things like laundry and cooking and cleaning and stuff but fundamentally those 24 hours or 168 hours a week are basically the same for everyone and assuming you're sleeping for eight hours every night we all basically have 112 hours in a given week that we can play with and the point of component number two is that we want to define the ideal week I.E our absolute ideal allocation of those 112 hours per week and this is a method I've been using for the last eight months or so ever since I started working with my CEO coach Eric ponteca and Eric has worked with a couple of hundred CEOs of really high growth companies and me and this is one of the methods that he asks all of his clients to do and apparently it's a method that always gets some results and it's certainly got me a lot of results over the last eight months and so instead of you having to pay several thousand dollars an hour for Eric's time I'm just going to teach you the method straight up and it's actually fairly straightforward to do all it involves is going on Google Calendar and it involves creating a new calendar so that you've got a completely fresh slate where you can do your audio week planning cool so I've now created Ali's ideal week and now you can see it's shown up in my Google Calendar right here and this is completely free everyone can use Google Calendar you don't have to pay a penny ever at all now at the moment my life is a little bit of a mess because of the YouTuber Academy happening and because of all the book stuff going on and all the meetings with the editors and the agents and all of that fun stuff and so what can often happen is that I actually don't have that ideal launch hour in which I'd like to cook a healthy lunch and so instead a product that I've been finding a lot of use of is in fact Hugh who are very kindly sponsoring this video now I've actually been a pain customer of huel since 2017 and since my penultimate year of medical school and actually when I first started this YouTube channel six years ago I've been taking heal fairly regularly and there's broadly two types of heal that I really enjoy the first one is heel black which is often what I have in the mornings as part of my morning routine it's 40 grams of protein 400kg memories I just Add Water blend it up in the NutriBullet blender thingy and then it turns into a genuinely tasty smoothie that has all of the right macros add all of the micronutrients that I might need for the day and the other heel product that I get a lot of value out of is the heel ready to drink and again I've been getting deliveries of this ever so I don't quite think this started in 2017 because this wasn't a thing in 2017 I think like since 2020 this has been a thing and I've been getting regular deliveries of these and it's basically a whole meal that's 100 nutritionally complete in a single bottle and if on a given day I don't have time to have a proper lunch then the heel ready to drink is an absolutely fantastic Lifesaver my favorite flavor is banana I think that's the best one but all of the others are pretty tasty as well now the best way of trying these I'd say is the variety pack because it gives you like three bottles of all of the four different flavors if you're interested in trying out any of these heel products including heel ready to drink then do hit the link in the video description and if you use that link then you will get two free products along with your fuel order you will get a free t-shirt which is genuinely good and it's nice and elasticy and like makes you look hinge which is a fantastic like quality t-shirt and you also get a Shaker so that if you don't want to use a like NutriBullet blender type thing you can just like put the thing put the powder into the water into the Shaker or shake it up and now you have a nutritionally complete meal that's basically ready to go so thank you so much heal for sponsoring this video and the point here is that basically I want to Define what are the containers of time where in an absolutely ideal week not necessarily a perfect week but in an ideal ordinary week how would I choose to be spending my time so for example I've decided that like in my ideal week Monday through to Friday I'd like to wake up at seven o'clock and then I'd like to have the first hour of the day for my morning routine and this is the thing I'd like to happen every day and so I'm going to repeat this daily and I'm going to give it this yellow color because that like signifies the sunrise or something like that and you know what why not add an emoji to it just to make this a bit more fun so we can see that this has now shown up across my ideal week and because I want to get my eight hours of sleep I want to aim to be asleep by 11 pm and therefore I want to be starting to get ready for bed around 10 doing my reading nighttime routine all that fun stuff and I'm going to repeat this every single day and I'm going to give this a lavender color to signify nighttime fantastic so we now have a Blog for waking up and we have a block for sleeping and now I can figure out what I want my ideal ordinary week to look like in the rest of the time I've decided that in my dream world from 8 till 9 every morning I'd like to do breakfast and journaling and in that blog I could maybe have a breakfast meeting with someone or maybe go for a walk and then I want my actual quote work day to start at 9am every day and So based on my own energy levels how would I like my ideal work day to go now obviously this is going to vary a bit depending on how much control you have over your own schedule for example when I worked as a doctor I just had my entire block being like nine to five workday or whatever this shift was and then I would just have to do whatever just happened on the day I couldn't quite decide you know what these are my four hours of deep work time but as an entrepreneur I can decide how I spend my time and actually increasingly in jobs especially in knowledge work you actually do have the ability to talk to your boss or your manager and say hey this is this is how I work best I would love it if we can kind of find a way to fit my calendar around this and then obviously based on the needs of the business and the team or whatever things will have to adjust accordingly and so I've added in the blocks for the weekly team meeting the weekly team lunch weekly content Squad meeting and my two meetings a week with Angus who's my general manager and I've added in the blocks for when I want to have lunch roughly and the blocks for when I want to have dinner on weekdays and this is already very helpful because now I can see what is the other time that I have to play with and then I can adapt this ideal ordinary week based on how I'd actually want to spend that time and so Tuesdays to Fridays for example I want to have several hours in the morning as a deep work block for writing and in my ideal week I'd like to do a gym session Tuesday afternoon Thursday noon and maybe Saturday morning if I happen to be free on the Saturday morning now the other main thing I need to do in my work day is filming and so I'm going to put in my various filming blocks into the calendar and obviously this workday schedule is very specific for me because basically all I have to do in my job is writing and filming but if your job is a little bit different than that then maybe you might have a Blog for checking slack or checking emails and you might do that once or twice a day so that you're batching those interruptible activities and you're not just spending your entire day being like derailed by all the various emails coming your way alternatively maybe you have more meetings than I do and therefore you have more meetings on the calendar at all the different blocks the point is mold this to whatever works for you but the point is we want to create these containers within our ideal week where in an ideal ordinary week we would be intentionally using our time in this way and what you can base these containers on is firstly what are the constraints of your job but also how are your own energy levels like if you're managing your own energy do you do your best creative work in the morning or in the evening do you have a slump after lunch and therefore maybe you want to take calls then rather than do particularly deep work and the great thing about this and what I do is that I also intentionally schedule in the personal life and relationship stuff that I want to put into my ideal week so for example in my case ideally every Thursday evening is date night so I know that I have that fully scheduled in the calendar and now the rest of my life can fit around that and then on Monday evenings as well I'd like to go to a kickboxing class and have a mini date night as well in my ideal week Tuesday evenings would for example be a social dinner with friends because I'm trying to learn how to cook and I like having friends over and so I've decided just by default every Tuesday evening is going to be free so that I've got an easy slot where if a friend is visiting London or if I want to invite people over just by default I don't have to think too hot about it it's a Tuesday evening and conveniently the cleaner rocks up on a Wednesday and so I can leave the kitchen in a mess and then the cleaner will sort it out that's fantastic stuff I might decide on Wednesday evenings by default I'd like to drive home to have dinner with my mom and grandma and I might decide to leave weekends completely free for friends and family and other things in life that are happening now having this laid out in front of me is incredibly useful and this is in fact the system that I follow basically every week and then obviously there's other stuff that kind of derails this sometimes sometimes there's an urgent meeting that can't be missed or sometimes I have to go pick up my mum from the airport and then a filming blog gets to get but the point is I have defined the parameters of my ideal ordinary week and now I don't need to be fully wedded to them but at least I've actively decided that on average on a Wednesday morning I'd like to be doing a deep work block of writing because that's the main thing that moves my business forward and it makes sense to do that in the morning while I have more creative energy similarly the fact that I've basically decided that Mondays and Thursdays are going to be date night that that means that those evenings are sacred and like if someone says hey do you want to hang out and it's Monday or Thursday night then my default option is no sorry I can't make it can you do Tuesday instead or Friday instead and if it's super super urgent and it's like an internet friend visiting London and they're only here on a Monday then I can say to my girlfriend hey do you mind if we switch date night to Tuesday or whatever that week so the point is this kind of system allows a level of flexibility and I found that over the last eight months of using it it's just freed up so much headspace from my life having to think about these things because now at least I have a default structure that I can follow the other cool thing about this is that it really shows where it genuinely where is the free time like I might decide you know what I'm really interested in the guitar I want to get better at the guitar and therefore I'd like to have one guitar lesson every week now the question is where am I where am I going to fit this one guitar lesson every week I have these 112 hours that I can play with like everyone else does and so I might decide you know what I'm going to finish work a little bit earlier on a Wednesday to have my guitar lesson but I can do that because I'm an entrepreneur and I control my own time but if this is what my calendar looked like and I was only getting home from my actual job at like 6 30 every day and I knew that I wanted to have a social evening with friends once a week go home for dinner with my parents once a week and I have date night twice a week it's like I actually don't have that much time to play with to fit in a guitar lesson and that means I don't need to beat myself up about it I might think you know what at some point in my life when I have more free time on the calendar I will fit in that guitar lesson but it's just not a priority right now and what I love about this ideal ordinary week exercise is that it forces us to decide what are the priorities in our life it means we can't say oh I don't have the time we can instead say I'm choosing not to make the time I'm currently choosing not to make the time in my life for guitar lessons or singing lessons and I'm currently choosing in my life to only go to the gym two or three times a week because I've decided that that's what the priority is in the future maybe once my book is done and I have fewer writing blocks or maybe I decide you know what I want to take a break from film four times a week for a month and see what happens I'll free up more time but the point is I now know how much time I have to play with but until I did this exercise eight months ago a I would not have known that and I was kind of taking on too many responsibilities and too many too much stuff and then feeling overwhelmed and B on a given day I didn't really have a default list of things that I wanted to do and so I'd have to think every single day I was like okay how do I want to spend my time today and that's just quite a lot of thinking now this is how this actually translates to what my ideal week looks like in real life so right now we're in the midst of our part-time YouTuber Academy so Mondays are literally taken up entirely from with PTY stuff except an exercise Block in the morning Tuesday morning Wednesday morning Friday morning Saturday morning and Thursday afternoons are all book time because I'm in the final stages of my book and so I need to make the blocks for that I have various meetings in the calendar so we've moved our team meetings to Tuesday so we've got a team meeting and our content meeting on a Tuesday afternoon we're doing a team training thing with our coach Eric and so that happens on Wednesday afternoon and this week I've had various lunches with various team members because I like to have a one-on-one lunch with every member of the team once every couple of months or so similarly this week I did a podcast with my internet friend cycle Bloom so that happen on a Tuesday and then we went out to a restaurant so you can kind of see how this calendar evolves over time and it evolves depending on what's happening in a given week but this week I've broadly stuck to the calendar I've done book time what I intended to currently I'm in a filming block which is why I'm filming this video and then later today I've got book time for the rest of the afternoon so I can focus on making those final edits and it's just so liberating to have this kind of system I'll put the template for the Google Calendar ideal week if you want to check it out down in the video description again it's completely free you just click the link and you can download the template and if you try any of the strategies in this video I'd love to hear how you got on please can you drop me an email Ali alibdal.com I read absolutely everything even if I can't reply to everything and I'd just love to hear kind of what are the strategies and tips you found helpful and maybe you can even leave a comment down below if you try any of this stuff out again I'd love to hear what are the pros what are the cons what are the ways you've adapted it to fit your own system and your own life alright the final component of the Trident method is what we do on a given day so we've talked about annual planning and what our annual Life Plan year at a glance looks like and we've talked about at the level of the ideal week how we're trying to make the most of these 112 hours in the week that we have to play with and how we can use them more intentionally and so now the third component of the Trident method is what we're doing on a given day and so the way I manage my time on a given day is broadly I follow what is in the calendar and again having the calendar just makes it so easy it is a Thursday right now and I just literally follow whatever blocks I've put in my calendar and generally on the weekend before I will look forward at my calendar for the upcoming week and I will create blocks of time for the things that I want to do and so for example let's say I'm looking over to next week I've already got a lot of this stuff penciled in because it's recurring events or it's ideal week stuff and because I know that basically every morning I want to do book stuff and every afternoon I want to do kind of filming stuff and I want to go to the gym two or three times I just need to add in those blocks and normally I'd have those in as like repeated blocks that's just in every week but right now things are very derailed thanks to the YouTuber Academy and so I'm kind of going week by week but keeping in mind what does my ideal week actually look like so for example right now 7am badminton is not happening so let's decline this one let's create a book time block on Wednesday morning let's create a book time block on Friday morning this app is fantastic Hal by the way it's just a fancy calendar version of Google Calendar the nice thing is you can duplicate events so it makes it super easy to like literally hit alt and then drag and now I can just duplicate an event rather than having to recreate it like I would in Google Calendar let's put in my filming blocks now this is currently a bit of a problem because I don't have enough time for exercise here so I'm gonna have to create some exercise blocks but then genuinely on the level of day planning let's say it was Monday I would literally just follow whatever I have planned so I know for example at eight o'clock I'm going to be doing my content planning for the session of the part-time YouTuber Academy I've got my call with the exec students at nine and then another one at five I've got more ptya prep happening from 10 to 12. I have a YouTuber's Mastermind that I'm part of I have the two hour keynote that I deliver on a Monday and then I'm going for aftar and dinner at a friend's house that evening and so on one level that's just what I do on a given day I just follow whatever's in the calendar but there's another thing that I do and again this is one of those things that I've started doing for the last eight months ever since starting working with Eric and it's basically defining three daily quests daily quests I mean he calls it daily number ones or whatever I call it daily quests because it's terminology from World of Warcraft and basically the idea is that in the three most important domains of life I have three quests that I'm doing every day and that's in work in health and in relationships and we've actually recently started a slack group where we do this with the whole team so that we've got some level of accountability on this and so for example today my health daily Quest is to go to the gym after my book Squad call and then I make sure it's scheduled in the calendar so I already have my exercise blog scheduled in the calendar after my call with the book team my work daily Quest is I want to film stuff which is literally what I'm doing right now and that's already in the calendar and then my relationship thing is that I want to call my grandma and calling my grandma is not yet in the calendar and so I'm literally just going to add it in here as a task call Nani and that will show up in my calendar and now I know that that's going to get done because I look at my calendar multiple times a day because my calendar tells me literally what I'm doing in fact you know what I'm gonna be a good grandson and I'm going to call my grandma straight after filming this video and I can literally drag that task straight onto the calendar and it's very convenient because it overlaps with the events and it means that I again ensure that the things that I actually want to do are in the calendar now this method of like just literally running your life based on a calendar is completely game changing I've been doing it in various forms for the last 10 years and before I started literally living my life based on my calendar I was so disorganized I was so chaotic but now that I live my life based on my calendar and on the level of annual on the level of weekly and monthly and on the level of daily I just follow the intention I've already set that's been one of the main drivers of my productivity for the last 10 years and specifically this trident method thing that I've been doing for the last eight months since working with Eric in terms of the annual thing the weekly thing and the daily thing has been hugely helpful in moving me forward and even though I'm I think at this point one of the most followed productivity experts in the world like these three strategies I just have just been genuinely game changing in terms of how helping me make the most of my time and helping me boost my time management skills because as we've already talked about time is the most valuable resource that we have we can always make more money but we can never make more time and if we can use our time more intentionally again it doesn't have to be about being more productive with every single hour it's about just being more intentional with it intentionally calling my grandma intentionally making the time for date night or for having dinner with my mom and the more I find that I Define these containers and then actually follow them the more I find that like life is balanced and fulfilled and meaningful and I'm happy and then it's like I don't have to stress about things because I know that the important things are getting done because fundamentally they are on the calendar now if you enjoyed this video and you'd like some more time management tips then check out this video over here which is 10 specific other strategies that I found helpful over the last decade for managing my time thank you so much for watching I hope you enjoyed the video and I'll see you hopefully in the next one bye`

		transcript: `speaking of folding phones speaking of Apple needing to catch up with this stuff yeah uh Apple is is allegedly catching up with this stuff so there was a big leak uh recently that apple is actually potentially allegedly going to be producing a foldable iPhone in 2026 maybe possibly Ellis looks very frustrated no the opposite excited excited I want to know how many things we've said in this podcast between the alleged Roadster and the alleged folding iPhone that have been said exactly the same in how many episodes of way for this is just kind of the state of tech journalism in 2024 everything is just real and then it's not real and then it's real again you're welcome um yeah obviously we've heard about folding iPhones for Millennia at this point but apparently allegedly there are suppliers in different parts of Asia that are actually getting orders for parts for a folding iPhone um very similar to the galaxyy Z flip unfortunately for the fans of the hot dog out there um not going to be an opening phone in the way that it opens horizontally but it will be much more like a Galaxy Z flip where it gets smaller I do like Samsung has nailed the folding phone in general so good that like when we say fold we think book style hot dog style and when we say flip we think of that like that's true yeah would you just say flip style flip style like I think that's the easiest way of saying it fold if you say a folding phone it's like the fold if you say flipping phone that's actually a good point like they have almost googlefi the idea of a folding phone is there a name for that like being so popular you turn into a verb Kleenex Google when you're brand new it's not a verb but but I think it just may be more so than gener gener try to pronounce that generative AI genericization gen generici generation genericization or genericide that sounds terrible yeah we got to cut no that's what it says I know no that's the word it's when your yeah when your product/ brand name becomes the noun of the thing interesting taser um Taser Taser is not brand name brand I mean it's an acronym but it's also a brand name it's trademarked oh W New Jersey has a extremely specific one which is our pork roll a lot of Taylor Ham no Taylor ham is the brand the brand sorry sorry yeah get it's the I'm from californ sorry I just said the wrong thing I know I I've heard this argument my whole life boy all right let's get back let's get back to the folding hamburgers and hot dogs guys yeah okay so Samsung so Apple allegedly going to make a flippy iPhone yes the question is is that what we want is that cuz I've said this on the podcast before is apple has a bunch of flipping folding iPhone prototypes somewhere underground in Apple Park and they've been trying to decide which one for a while and it seems like they're going to do the flippy one my reaction is it's yeah it's the most popular one but it doesn't feel like the most uh Difference Maker considering the state of the women's clothing industry fa I think this is going to do very well I think this pops yeah and like because of what we've already said apple is so prominent in the us I think there are so many people who have iPhones now they're like wow Samsung is doing this really cool thing but I'm not ditching my iPhone and think about every time an iPhone kind of changes and becomes like some part of it becomes iconic now this is going to be become iconic even though four four or five other manufacturers have done it already in the US it's going to pop I think that folding phones well F fold style phones Galaxy fold style phones are like super user phones like there's no way any regular person just went and bought a OnePlus open or so there's a couple reasons for that I mean yes they're also huge and they're like not ideal but they're also like always the most expensive they're always twice the price of all the other phones that's true so good point not that Apple's going to be cheap and change that but yeah but I think there's also something to be said for like when it's a flip phone the the concept is that you're not using your phone quite as often whereas the fold phone is that you're using your phone the same amount but when you're really using it you're super using it you know and so the idea of the flip phone is for I guess more targeted at like fashion and normies because they're not like the power users that are constantly wanting to do things big on their phone it's not extra functionality it's extra Pocket ability and and it still does have a wise a wow factor yeah like people like wow factors and phones I think we all know that but this is I think the flip flip style makes perfect sense for it makes the most sense trying to picture an apple flipping iPhone and if there's any way that they can differentiate from all the ones that are already out cuz I feel like I feel like we've seen it all but I also felt like that about VR headsets and now they have the googly eyes on the outside so is there is there an Apple version here's how it's different uhhuh it folds it has an Apple logo on it I mean Oh you mean from other that's good enough for a lot of people yeah that's good enough for a lot of people all I feel like they're just going to put everything that's cool about the dynamic Island under front screen I don't think it'll be an actual usable screen kind of like the Samsung phones or they just won't have a screen on the front that that would be crazy would be tough doesn't that defeat the point not really I don't think so I need to see the time or something on theide it's funny I want to see the back more than the front of the folding iPhone they did such a good job with standby mode on the current iPhone I feel like they could really whip up something really that would be cool yeah so my question is there was this leak a few weeks ago that I believe we covered that they are apparently trying to release an iPhone Slim in 2027 but I'm wondering if these are the same product because in the article that I read the articles that I read about the folding iPhone they said they're actively still working to make it thinner so I'm wondering if these are like the same product and the leaks got mixed up somehow um which would be interesting yeah but apparently it's moving ahead which is good to see because you know the last major design change that we saw on the iPhone was the iPhone 12 and even that was like you know we went from circular to squared off I feel like the 10 was the one everyone remembers yeah and yeah the difference between the iPhone 15 and 16 is like probably not going to be that much yeah you know yeah there's apparently going yeah wait no yeah the variable aperture is apparently going to be in the 17 I think there's a there were a lot of Apple leaks this week uh including apparently allegedly a foldable MacBook like device foldable display yeah cuz everyone always says that that would be so funny yeah I know I know I know already we get it but okay foldable display laptop but apparently uh it should have two options of either 18.8 in or 20 in that's almost the same I don't know 20 in is pretty big 19 and 20 well well wa wait yeah 20-in display when the display is folded out and then doesn't have keyboard and it has so that is still half the size it said when it's folded in it's about 15 inch and then it's fold it out it's about 20 in oh oh so it's doing some wait that sounds some like Moto razor yeah so it said when it's closed uh well when it's like folded closed it's about the smaller one is 13 to 14 in uhhuh and when it's open it's 18.8 and then the bigger one is about 15 in closed and 20 in open so footprint wise there's two laptops a 13in and a 15in when they're closed yes when you open them they're a big foldable screen so the small one is an 18in and the large one is a 20 that feels like too small at I still think is not that big 15 to 20 in no 18 to 18.8 to 20 well yeah what from what I read you're still going to be able to use it when it's when it's not unfolded oh so it's not like it's not yeah it's it's like expanding not okay closed completely I guys the I am so excited about this because because I need someone to draw this for me the best my favorite form factor of any modern device I've used mhm like like modern computer the books pal no form factor the Asus Zenbook 17 fold oh that computer sucks that computer's really it really is terrible but the form factor where that you've got the keyboard that you lay over the bottom half of the screen you open it you can put it on the kickstand you can use it as a little laptop if Apple could perfect that this is one I found where there's two concepts so these are just Concepts but if this is the way the concept works it would make the most sense in terms of the numbers that you're saying this is uh who posted this here's Majin Buu is the concept of who made it imag imine a Macbook and then the screen just comes all the way down to where the the keyboard is and it's basically a touch bar now and that folds so you're gaining like an inch vertically of space and the whole length around that's why you're only going from like 15 to 18 in but that display is under this Verge article says uh kuo says that Apple's considering an 18 okay uh kind of Fire 18.8 in panel when closed the 20-in version will reportedly look similar to the 14 to 15in MacBook while the 18.8 in device will look like a 13 to 14 inch MacBook I see that's what kuo is reporting and that Verge covered but that's a different so okay who knows they just seem to want to bring the touch bar idea back I I would lean towards that because if the just full screen folding in half I would assume they'd call that a folding iPad not a folding Mac well does it run Mac OS or I true I got kicked out of calculus because I faked taking trigonometry and but you didn't know well what I did was I took trigonometry through Stanford during the summer online but I didn't finish it and uh but I enrolled in calculus and I tried really hard and I failed everything and at one point my teacher was like David you didn't take trick did you oh I was like damn that's like when your dentist is like you don't floss then you look that dentist in the you're like you know the answer to that well I think the dentist is usually like do you floss and you're like yeah like yeah yeah for sure and they're like me you don't fck have you ever heard the the you they say Do you ever floss and you say yeah religiously and they're like it doesn't look like and you're like Christmas and Easter Sundays like And subscribe and floss your teeth yeah oh [Music]`

		transcript: `We are in the Plex. This is the center of Google. Gosh, it's hard to remember life before Google. It changed literally everything. How we live, how we work, how we communicate, how we get literally anywhere on a Googly colored bike. Google has been the front door of the internet for over two decades, and now there are so many doors. Google may not be the first place you go for answers anymore, so what are they gonna do about it? Hello. Hi, Emily. So good to meet you again. Good to see you again. Thanks so much for having us here. Oh, likewise. I'm glad you chose a sunny day to come on campus. It's beautiful. Sundar Pichai is at a pivotal moment. He's the CEO of Google and its parent company, Alphabet, rising to the top after proving his medal as a talented product leader and peacemaker. He runs a tech giant that functions more like a micro country, overseeing businesses as consequential as YouTube, DeepMind, Cloud, and, of course, Search. Pichai has been carefully crafting a strategy that infuses AI into every corner of the business. That deliberate planning was met with a surprise from longtime rival Microsoft and OpenAI, whose chatbot seemingly knocked Google off its perch and challenged its cultural relevance. ChatGPT set off a code red at Google, and an industry-wide fever pitch over AI not seen since the dot-com boom. But for Pichai, the frenzy is just part of the long game. I saw it's your 20th anniversary. That's right. It was last week. It crept upon me. Are you coffee or tea? I'll go for coffee. How about you? I'm gonna have a green tea. Does it feel like you've been here for 20 years? Not quite. You know, time flies by. You know, I had my kids right when I started Google too, so the whole thing just flew by. Google is famous for those out-of-the box job interview questions. Do you remember any of yours? Like, did you have to figure out how many golf balls fit in a school bus or something like that? Thank God. No. You know, but, you know, I remember very, very clearly I interviewed on April 1st, so it was April Fool's Day 2004. There was rumor. I didn't know whether it had actually happened, but Gmail apparently had launched. So all my interviews were about Gmail. People wanted to know what I thought of the product. And it definitely wasn't a joke? They launched it. They actually launched it, yeah. But I never allow, no products on April Fool's Day. I think it's too confusing. You just had a blowout quarter. The stock jumped more than it has in a long time. Did that feel like a little bit of vindication, or, as they say in cricket, was that the bat talking? In many ways, you know, it felt we worked very hard to set up the company for that. You know, in 2016, one of the first things I did as CEO was to say the company should be AI first. To me, we are just getting started in the beginning of what I think will be a extraordinary decade of innovation, and so I'm incredibly excited about it. AI has been around for decades, but it seems like everything is happening everywhere, all at once. How do you make sense of the frenzy and the scale? All tech cycles are this way, right? You know, the- But this one feels different. It feels bigger. Is it? It is bigger. We still have long ways to go, but we are in the early stages of that. And so, you know, you're gonna feel that excitement, that frenzy, but I think we are prepared for it. So you kind of roll with the flow. You embrace it. How are you and your kids experimenting with AI at home? We use Google Lens for homework. I don't want to get 'em in trouble, but the class allows you to do that. But sometimes he asks me for help on math. I dunno. Sometimes I'm lazy and I pretend as if I'm thinking, but I'm also using Google Lens to kind of figure out the answer. You grew up in Chennai in India. What was it like at the kitchen table? Like, what got you here? My parents always emphasized, you know, learning and knowledge, and it's worked in some ways, Google with its mission, it always resonated very deeply with me. You know, I felt this quest for learning knowledge, et cetera. It's what the company is about, too. I grew in a middle-class family. I perceived our life through the arrival of gadgets. We waited five years for a telephone. It was a rotary phone, but when it came to our home, you know, it changed everyone's lives. I remember getting our first television and suddenly being able to watch sports. You know, I used to bike a long way to school, but, you know, there was no gear in the bike, and I had to go uphill. But then, after many years, I got a bike with gears, and, like, I'm like, "Wow, this thing make, you know, what a dramatic difference." I never took technology for granted. And so that's what, you know, always been optimistic about how technology can make a difference. You've been CEO now for a decade. How have you changed in that time? I think the main thing is when you've done it for a while, you know, you get to understand patterns, so you're running into something, but there's a sense of deja vu, you know, you've seen it before. And so I think that helps you kind of pattern match and deal with it more effectively. But a lot of this is, you know, this scale, you have so much coming at you, there's a lot of noise, and most of it doesn't matter. So the ability to separate the signals from the noise, pay attention to the few things that you need to pay attention to. And, you know, I think I've gotten better at that over the years. I heard Sergey is back and working a bit on AI. What is the involvement of Larry and Sergey these days, and what advice are they giving you? I talk to them regularly. Sergey is actually spending more time in the office. He's literally coding. And, you know, some of my fondest memories over the last year is sitting with Sergey on large screen looking at lost curves as we train these models. I think one of the advantages they have is they're not caught up in the day-to-day. And so sometimes, when I have conversations with them, it allows all of us to step back and look at the bigger picture, which I think is incredibly important when you run something at this scale. The decisions Pichai and Google make influence how billions of people get information. And the nature of how users do that is starting to change in the age of AI. This seems like a threat to Google, except the core technology being used by Google's competitors was invented by Google itself. Google researchers invented the transformer, literally the T in GPT. Do you wish you capitalized on that louder and sooner? We use transformers in Search. That's what led to large gaps in Search quality compared to other products. So we have infused transformers across our products. We have a chance to do that better with generative AI and with the Gemini series of models. And there's gonna be more breakthroughs in this field. But what is more important is we are driving that progress. And if the new Google is only gonna be more and more AI, you know, AI is super helpful sometimes, but sometimes it's still deeply wrong. Where do you draw the line? I think part of what makes Google Search differentiator is while there are times we give answers, it'll always link to a wide variety of sources. Now we've had answers in Search now for many, many years. We are just now using generative AI to do that. So the links will live on. Yes, and, you know, I think it'll always be an important part of Search. There will be times when they want quick answers. My son is celiac, so we did a quick question to see whether something is gluten-free. We just want to know. But often it leads to more things, and, you know, then you want to explore more. I think understanding that, meeting all that needs is part of what makes Search unique. Some leading computer scientists have said Search is getting worse, more SEO spam, et cetera. Do you see their point? Anytime there's a transition, you get an explosion of new content, and AI is going to do that. So for us, we view this as the challenge, and I actually think, you know, there'll be people who will struggle to do that, right? So doing that well is what will define a high-quality product, and I think it's gonna be the heart of what makes Search successful. You make a ton of money on ads next to the links generated by searches. If a chatbot is giving you answers and not links, and maybe more answers than links sometimes, are we in the midst of an assault on Google's business model? So we've always found people want choices, including in commercial areas, and that's a fundamental need. And I think we've always been able to balance it. As we are rolling out AI or views in Search, we've been experimenting with ads, and the data we see shows that those fundamental principles will hold true during this phase as well. The images that Gemini initially generated of Asian Nazis and Black founding fathers, you've said that was unacceptable. If you look at any pictures of the founding fathers, you're seeing old white men. People are calling this woke AI, and it's not just happening here, it's happening across the industry. How did the model generate something that it never saw? We are a company which serves products to users around the world, and there are generic questions. For example, people come and say, "Show me images of school teachers, or doctors, or nurses." We have people asking this query from Indonesia or the US, right? How do you get it right for our global user base? Obviously, the mistake was that we overapplied, including cases where it should have never applied. So that was the bug, and, you know, so we got it wrong. Would you say it's like good intentions gone awry? In this particular case, yes, right? I think, you know, we are rightfully held to a high bar, and I think we clearly take responsibility for it, and we are gonna get it right. How concerned are you about AI-generated content ruining Search? For example, the AI-generated selfie of the tank man in Tiananmen Square. It shows up in Google search results, but it never happened. The challenge for everyone and the opportunity is, how do you have a notion of what's objective and real in a world where there's gonna be a lot of synthetic content? I think it's part of what will define Search in the next decade ahead, right? People often come to Google right away to see whether something they saw somewhere else actually happen. It's a common pattern we see. We are making progress, but it's gonna be an ongoing journey, right? You've got AI systems that are running out of training data. You've got companies turning to AI-generated data to train their models. Aren't there risks to that? Yes. I think that, you know, through it all, are you creating new knowledge? Are these models developing reasoning capabilities, right? Are you making progress in the intelligence of these models? I think those are the frontiers we need to prove that, you know, you can do that by using these techniques. Is LLM technology nearing a plateau? I would be surprised if LLMs are the only thing we would need to make progress. We are investing a lot of computing and resources. Our AI research is talent in driving the next generation set of breakthroughs. It seems, when you look at the big picture, like Google missed the big moment, and ChatGPT took it. A new artificial intelligence program called ChatGPT made its debut online. It's as revolutionary as the internet. The topic of today's big take is also Microsoft, and it's big bet on AI and how it just kind of leapfrogged over Google and no one kind of knew about it until now. If you could go back, what would you do differently? To be clear, I take a long-term perspective and say, when the internet just first came about, Google didn't even exist then, right? So we were in the first company to do search, we were in the first company to do email, we were in the first company to build a browser. So I view this AI as, you know, we are in the earliest possible stages. Your leadership style has been described as slow, and steady, and cautious, sometimes maybe too cautious, and you're often compared to these other tech leaders who are moving fast and breaking things. How would you describe yourself? Look, the reality, I think, is quite different. One of the first things I did when I became a CEO was to pivot the company sharply to focus on AI as well as really invest more in YouTube and Cloud to build them into big businesses. I think the larger the company is, you are making fewer consequential decisions, but they need to be clear, and you have to point the whole company to that. Part of that, at times, involves bringing the company along. You build consensus because that's what allows you to have maximum impact behind those decisions. I mean, any leader in a position like yours has to be willing to hear the criticism. And I'm not gonna make you read the mean tweets like they do on "Late Night," but I do have a few. "Where is Google?" "Running things through legal." "Google doesn't have one single visionary leader, not a one." Do you think you're the right person to lead Google? Look, it's a privilege to lead the company. You know, people tend to focus in this micro moment, but it is so small in the context of what's ahead, and, you know, when I look at the opportunities ahead across everything we do, and for the first time, all of that has a calm and leveraged technology with AI. You know, I put a lot of chips, at least from my perspective on Google. So can you walk through campus without getting stopped? It's definitely been nice to walk and see people, you know, so I enjoy it a lot. I see a dinosaur statue in the distance, which I think is a good reminder. Like, how much do you worry about becoming a dinosaur in a world where technology is moving so quickly? I mean, in technology, I think, if you don't innovate to stay ahead, I think that's the inevitable fate of any company. No dinosaurs? Not yet. Well, they were great, but you know, you don't want, you don't want to have the same fate. How much has this AI moment forced you to move and think differently? Because it does seem like you're playing defense sometimes. We have been preparing for this for a while. You know, a lot of the foundation of breakthroughs in the field came from Google. So to me, this moment has been over the past year, really channeling the company to meet the moment. There they are. The I/O tents. I/O tent. For one time a year, we get to pretend as if we are on a concert stage, except we are speaking about technology. So Google I/O is sort of a state of the Google Union. What is the key message this year? It's less about, you know, particular product, more about the journey we are on, the vision we have for how AI can transform our products, and how we can bring it. Alphabet used to be thought of as this collection of moonshots, but a lot of those projects have been spun off, or folded back into Google, or shut down. How should we think about Alphabet today? What is the new Google? When we think about both across Google and Alphabet, the underlying bet is the same. You're going to invest in deep technology and computer science and apply it to solve problems for people. So I think that part doesn't change. When you take big, large-scale bets, by definition, you're not aiming big enough if you don't have a few failures. When you go back to the S-1, Google said, "We're not a conventional company. You can spend 20% of your time on personal projects." Google created this bottoms up culture where everyone has a voice, and it's super transparent, and the perks are great too. But did it go too far? Like, did it become an entitlement culture? Part of what makes Google unique is, I think, there is a culture of vibrant, open debate. And so I think it's super important to preserve that. I think we are also a company where employees have many ways to speak up, and I think that's made the company better. Google, Google, you can't hide. Google, Google, you can't hide. You recently fired Google employees who were protesting this contract with the Israeli government for cloud services. It seemed like a distinct change in tone for a company that's historically welcomed all kinds of views. Why did you take this stand? I think when we have cases, including in this case where a few employees, you know, cross beyond what's in the code of contact and disrupt the productivity of the workplace, or do so in a way that it makes other people feel uncomfortable, I think we have to take action, and that's what we are doing. It has nothing to do with the topic they are discussing. It's about the conduct of how they went about it. Over the past years, through the pandemic, the company has grown a lot. There are a lot of new people. I view, particularly in this moment with AI, the opportunity we have ahead of us is immense, but it needs a real focus on our mission. There have been multiple rounds of layoffs. Why take this approach? Why not cut once and cut deep? We are reallocating people to our highest priorities. There are cases where you're simplifying teams, you're moving people to focus on newer areas, removing layers so that you can improve velocity. So that's why we have taken the time to do it correctly and well. Microsoft is obviously making huge investments in AI as well. OpenAI, Inflection, Mistral. We've reported that their OpenAI investment was actually in part because they were worried about Google and wanted to catch up. How do you feel about the competition? I've always held a view if you're working in the technology space, there is a lot of competition. We see it all the time. The way you stay ahead is by innovating relentlessly. It has to be true all the time. It's happening at a faster pace. But, you know, technology, changes tend to get faster over time, so it's not surprising to me at all. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has had some fighting words. I hope that with our innovation, they will definitely want to come out and show that they can dance. And I want people to know that we made them dance, and I think that'll be a great day. Who's really choosing the dance music? I think one of the ways you can do the wrong thing is by listening to noise out there and playing to someone else's dance music. I've always been very clear. I think we have a clear sense of what we need to do. So you're listening to your own music. That's exactly right. Google is facing a ton of regulatory pressure in the US, abroad, over your dominance in Search, video, ads, the app store. Some other big companies have split themselves up to focus on their core. Has Google thought about that? A lot of our products integrate in a way that provides value for our users. So I think that is important. Part of what allows us to compete in the Google Cloud market is our, the investment in AI we undertook because of Search is what allows us to take that and compete hard against other larger companies, like Amazon and Microsoft, in Cloud. So I would argue that the way we are approaching it drives innovation and adds choice in the market. What do you think is the future or potential of AI-powered hardware, and what will Google's role in it be? I think with AI, you get a chance to rethink that experience over the next few years. I still see the center of where the AI innovation will happen in smartphones, followed by glasses, right? That's how I see it. Last time we talked, you told me China will be at the forefront of AI. How should policymakers factor that into their decisions? I think over time we need to develop frameworks by which we achieve global cooperation to achieve AI safety. I know it sounds farfetched now, but we've done it in other areas, like nuclear technology and so on, to some extent. I think we are gonna need framework like that. And so I would expect, over time, there needs to be engagement with China on important issues like AI safety. Artificial general intelligence. What does it mean to you? Do we get there and when? It's not a well-defined phrase, it means different things to different people. But I think if you define AGI as AI becoming capable across a wide variety of economic activity and being able to do it well, I think that's one way to look at it. So Google's gonna get us to AGI? You know, we are committed to making foundational progress towards AGI in a bold and responsible way. And so, you know, I'll focus on the effort to do that and do that well. You've said there's even some things about AI that you don't understand. Will AI always be somewhat in a black box? I have a little bit of a counterintuitive view there. I think, you know, humans are very mysterious, too. Often, when people explain why they did things, you know, they're telling something, it's not entirely clear. Today, we can't make sense of many complex systems. AI will give us more insights and more visibility into many complex things. When I asked OpenAI CEO Sam Altman why we should trust him, he said. You shouldn't. Why should we trust Google? Well, I share the notion that no one, you shouldn't blind lead, you know? That's why it's important to have systems in place. Regulation has a part to play, you know, test balance innovation. But as these AI systems get more capable, it shouldn't just be based on a system of trust people or trust companies. We've talked a lot about the opportunities. What is the biggest threat to Google's future? I view for all companies, particularly, you know, at scale, you know, the biggest threat is not executing well. Is there a healthy dose of paranoia? Like not becoming Stan the T-Rex out there? I think that, you know, there's a part of me which has always internalized, I think, the old Andy Grove phase, "Only the paranoid survive." That is important. And I think this moment is no different. Are we gonna look back on this LLM era and laugh? Like, is this gonna all look so basic and rudimentary? I hope we do because that shows, you know, you know, my kids aren't impressed by touchscreens or the fact that they have this extraordinary amount of computing in their hands. So similarly, you know, there's no reason we wouldn't scale up our computing a hundred thousand times in a few years. So, yes, you know, I hope some of this looks like a toy in the future. I hope it is that way, otherwise, we didn't do our job well. Thank you so much. That was so awesome. She's more difficult than any AI to deal with, right? Oh, man.`
