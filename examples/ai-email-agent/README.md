## Build an AI Email Agent with Pipes — ⌘ Langbase

An AI powered email agent to help you analyze sentiment, summarize content, decides whether a response is needed or not, and generates replies for your emails. This agent is built by using multiple AI Pipes on Langbase which work with 30+ LLMs (OpenAI, Gemini, Mistral, Llama, Gemma, etc), any Data (10M+ context with Memory sets), and any Framework (standard web API you can use with any software).

Check out the live demo [here][demo].

## Features

-   📧 AI Email Agent — Built with multiple AI Pipes on ⌘ Langbase
    -   [Email Sentiment][email-sentiment] – A pipe to analyze the sentiment of the incoming email

1. Check the [AI Email Agent Pipes on ⌘ Langbase][agent-pipes]
2. Read the [source code on GitHub][gh] for this example
3. Go through Documentaion: [Pipe Quick Start][qs]
4. Learn more about [Pipes & Memory features on ⌘ Langbase][docs]

## Get started

Let's get started with the project:

To get started with Langbase, you'll need to [create a free personal account on Langbase.com][signup] and verify your email address. _Done? Cool, cool!_

1. Fork the following pipes on ⌘ Langbase.
    1. [Email Sentiment][email-sentiment]
    2. [Summarizer][summarizer]
    3. [Email Decision Maker][decision-maker]
    4. [Pick Email Writer][pick-email-writer]
    5. [Email Writer][email-writer]
2. Go to the API tab of each pipe to copy the pipe's API key (to be used on server-side only).
3. Download the example project folder from [here][download] or clone the repository.
4. `cd` into the project directory and open it in your code editor.
5. Duplicate the `.env.example` file in this project and rename it to `.env.local`.
6. Add the following environment variables:

```sh
# Fork https://langbase.com/examples/email-sentiment pipe to get the API key
# Replace `PIPE_API_KEY` with the copied API key of Code Alchemist Pipe.
LANGBASE_AI_PIPE_SENTIMENT_API_KEY="PIPE_API_KEY"

# Fork https://langbase.com/examples/summarizer pipe to get the API key
# Replace `PIPE_API_KEY` with the copied API key of Code Alchemist Pipe.
LANGBASE_AI_PIPE_SUMMARIZER_API_KEY="PIPE_API_KEY"

# Fork https://langbase.com/examples/decision-maker pipe to get the API key
# Replace `PIPE_API_KEY` with the copied API key of Code Alchemist Pipe.
LANGBASE_AI_PIPE_DECISION_MAKER_API_KEY="PIPE_API_KEY"

# Fork https://langbase.com/examples/pick-email-writer pipe to get the API key
# Replace `PIPE_API_KEY` with the copied API key of Code Alchemist Pipe.
LANGBASE_AI_PIPE_PICK_EMAIL_WRITER_API_KEY="PIPE_API_KEY"

# Fork https://langbase.com/examples/email-writer pipe to get the API key
# Replace `PIPE_API_KEY` with the copied API key of Code Alchemist Pipe.
LANGBASE_AI_PIPE_EMAIL_WRITER_API_KEY="PIPE_API_KEY"
```

7. Now execute the following commands in your terminal to run the project:

```sh
# Install the dependencies using the following command:
pnpm install

# OR if you are using npm, run the following command:
npm install

# Run the project using the following command:
npm run dev
```

Your app template should now be running on [localhost:3000][local]

> NOTE:
> This is a Next.js project, so you can build and deploy it to any platform of your choice, like Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare, etc.
