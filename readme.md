# ⌘ Langbase Examples — Open source AI Agents Pipes

Langbase helps developers ship composable AI agents with hyper-personalized memory (RAG).

Langbase is the composable AI infrastructure and developer experience to build, collaborate, and deploy any AI agents (AI features). Our mission is to make AI accessible to everyone, any developer not just AI/ML experts. We are the only [composable AI infrastructure][composable]. That's all we do.

1. Start by building AI agents [Pipes](/pipe/overview)
2. Then create managed semantic [memory (RAG)](/memory/overview), so your AI can talk to your data


> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **Langbase is free for anyone to [get started][signup]**.
> We process billions of AI message tokens daily, used by thousands of developers. [Tweet][x] us — what will you ship with Langbase?
> It all [started][start] with a developer thinking … GPT is amazing, I want it everywhere, that's what ⌘ Langbase does for me.

| Products | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [AI Pipes][pipe]<br>(Agents) | Your custom-built AI agent available as an API. Work with any language or framework. Highly scalable, dynamic, and inexpensive. You can deploy in seconds. A new LLM computing primitive called [Pipe][pipe]. Pipe is the fastest way to ship your AI features in production. It's like having a composable GPT anywhere. |
| [Memory](https://langbase.com/docs/memory/overview)<br>(RAG) | Memory is a managed search engine as an API for developers. Our long-term memory solution has the ability to acquire, process, retain, and later retrieve information. It combines vector storage, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and internet access to help you build powerful AI features and products. |
| [AI Studio](https://langbase.com/studio) | Langbase studio is your playground to build, collaborate, and deploy AI. It allows you to experiment with your pipes in real-time, with real data, store messages, version your prompts, and truly helps you take your idea from building prototypes to deployed in production with LLMOps on usage, cost, and quality.<br><br>A complete AI developers platform.<br><br>- **Collaborate**: Invite all team members to collaborate on the pipe. Build AI together.<br>- **Developers & Stakeholders**: All your R&D team, engineering, product, GTM (marketing and sales), literally invlove every stakeholder can collaborate on the same pipe. It's like a powerful version of GitHub x Google Docs for AI. A complete AI developers platform. |
